Subcutaneous Injection    Administer the dose of ADMELOG within fifteen minutes before a meal or immediately after a meal.  ADMELOG administered by subcutaneous injection should generally be used in regimens with intermediate or long-acting insulin.  ADMELOG should be administered by subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall, thigh, upper arm, or buttocks. Rotate injection site within the same region (abdomen, thigh, upper arm, or buttocks) from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .  The ADMELOG SoloStar prefilled pen dials in 1-unit increments.             Continuous Subcutaneous Infusion (Insulin Pump)    Administer ADMELOG by continuous subcutaneous infusion into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall. Rotate infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .  Follow healthcare provider recommendations when setting basal and mealtime infusion rate.  Do NOT dilute or mix ADMELOG when administering by continuous subcutaneous infusion.  Change ADMELOG in the pump reservoir at least every 7 days.  Change the infusion sets and the infusion set insertion site at least every 3 days.  Do NOT expose ADMELOG in the pump reservoir to temperatures greater than 98.6°F (37°C).  Use ADMELOG in accordance with the insulin infusion pump systems instructions for use. See the insulin infusion pump system labeling to determine if ADMELOG can be used with the pump system.             Intravenous Administration    Dilute ADMELOG to concentrations from 0.1 unit/mL to 1 unit/mL using 0.9% sodium chloride.  Administer ADMELOG intravenously ONLY under medical supervision with close monitoring of blood glucose and potassium levels to avoid hypoglycemia and hypokalemia  [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.3 ,  5.6) and  How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.4) ] .               Individualize and adjust the dosage of ADMELOG based on route of administration, the individual's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, and glycemic control goal.  Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function, or during acute illness  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2 ,  5.3) and  Use in Specific Populations (8.6 ,  8.7) ] .  If changing patients from another insulin lispro product to ADMELOG, the dose of ADMELOG should be the same as the other insulin lispro product  [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].              Dosage adjustment may be needed when ADMELOG is coadministered with certain drugs  [see  Drug Interactions (7) ] .  Dosage adjustment may be needed when switching from another insulin to ADMELOG  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .    Do NOT mix  ADMELOG with any other insulin.</Section>
    <Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">Drugs that Affect Glucose Metabolism:  Adjustment of insulin dosage may be needed. ( 7.1 ,  7.2 ,  7.3 )   Antiadrenergic Drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine):  Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent. ( 5.3 ,  7.4 )           The risk of hypoglycemia associated with ADMELOG use may be increased when coadministered with antidiabetic agents, salicylates, sulfonamide antibiotics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, fluoxetine, pramlintide, disopyramide, fibrates, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, and somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide). Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when ADMELOG is coadministered with these drugs.           The glucose lowering effect of ADMELOG may be decreased when coadministered with corticosteroids, isoniazid, niacin, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), somatropin, atypical antipsychotics, glucagon, protease inhibitors, and thyroid hormones. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when ADMELOG is coadministered with these drugs.           The glucose lowering effect of ADMELOG may be increased or decreased when coadministered with beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when ADMELOG is coadministered with these drugs.           The signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] may be blunted when beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine are coadministered with ADMELOG.</Section>
    <Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">Never share an ADMELOG SoloStar disposable prefilled pen or syringe between patients, even if the needle is changed. ( 5.1 )   Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen:  Carry out under close medical supervision and increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring. ( 5.2 )   Hypoglycemia:  May be life-threatening. Monitor blood glucose and increase monitoring frequency with changes to insulin dosage, use of glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; and in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness. ( 5.3 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8.6 ,  8.7 )   Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors:  Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. ( 5.4 )   Hypersensitivity Reactions:  Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergic, including anaphylaxis can occur. Discontinue ADMELOG, monitor and treat if indicated. ( 5.5 )   Hypokalemia:  May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. ( 5.6 )   Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs):  Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs. ( 5.7 )   Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction:  Monitor glucose and administer ADMELOG by subcutaneous injection if pump malfunction occurs. ( 5.8 )           ADMELOG SoloStar prefilled pen must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using ADMELOG vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.           Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]  or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and under close medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed.           Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including ADMELOG.  Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening, or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery).  Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers)  [see  Drug Interactions (7) ] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.          Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia   The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of ADMELOG may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature  [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to coadministered medication  [see  Drug Interactions (7) ] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6 ,  8.7) ] .            Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia   Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.             Accidental mix-ups between basal insulin products and other insulins, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been reported. To avoid medication errors between ADMELOG and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.           Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including ADMELOG. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue ADMELOG; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . ADMELOG is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin lispro or any of the excipients  [see  Contraindications (4) ] .           All insulin products, including ADMELOG, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations).           Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including ADMELOG, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.           Malfunction of the insulin pump or insulin infusion set or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with ADMELOG may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure  [see  How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2) and  Patient Counseling Information (17) ] .</Section>
    <Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">Regulation of glucose metabolism is the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogs, including insulin lispro products. Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhance protein synthesis.                 Subcutaneous Administration   The pharmacodynamic profile of a single 0.3 unit/kg dose of ADMELOG administered subcutaneously was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study enrolling 30 patients with type 1 diabetes. In this study, the mean (SD) time to maximum effect of ADMELOG (measured by the peak rate of glucose infusion) was approximately 2.07 (0.78) hours. The mean (SD) area under the glucose infusion rate curves (measure of overall pharmacodynamic effect) and mean (SD) maximum glucose infusion rate were 1953.5 (547.3) mg/kg and 9.97 (2.37) mg/min/kg, respectively (see  Figure 1 ).        Figure 1: Mean Smoothed Glucose Infusion Rate Body Weight Standardized after Subcutaneous Injection of ADMELOG (0.3 unit/kg) in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes              The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs, including insulin lispro products, may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual. The rate of insulin absorption, and consequently the onset of activity are known to be affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .      Figure 1               Intravenous Administration   The glucose lowering effect of intravenous administration of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, was tested in 21 patients with type 1 diabetes. For the study, the patients' usual doses of insulin were held and blood glucose concentrations were allowed to reach a stable range of 200 to 260 mg/dL during a one to three hour run-in phase. The run-in phase was followed by a 6-hour assessment phase. During the assessment phase, patients received intravenous infusion of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, at an initial infusion rate of 0.5 units/hour. The infusion rate could be adjusted at regular timed intervals to achieve and maintain blood glucose concentrations between 100 to 160 mg/dL.  The mean blood glucose levels during the assessment phase for patients on another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, therapy are summarized below in Table 2. All patients achieved the targeted glucose range at some point during the 6-hour assessment phase. At the endpoint, blood glucose was within the target range (100 to 160 mg/dL) for 17 of 20 patients treated with another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL. The average time (±SE) required to attain near normoglycemia was 129 ± 14 minutes for another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL.   Table 2: Mean Blood Glucose Concentrations (mg/dL) During Intravenous Infusions of Another Insulin Lispro Product, 100 units/mL      Time from Start of Infusion (minutes)  Mean Blood Glucose (mg/dL) Intravenous Results shown as mean ± SD.       0  224 ± 16    30  205 ± 21    60  195 ± 20    120  165 ± 26    180  140 ± 26    240  123 ± 20    300  120 ± 27    360  122 ± 25                      Absorption   The pharmacokinetic profile of a single 0.3 unit/kg dose of ADMELOG administered subcutaneously was evaluated in a study enrolling 30 patients with type 1 diabetes. In this study, the mean observed area under the plasma insulin lispro concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity and peak plasma insulin lispro concentration were 12800 pg∙hr/mL and 5070 pg/mL, respectively. The median time to maximum plasma insulin lispro concentration was 0.83 hours after injection (see  Figure 2 ).   Figure 2: Mean Plasma Concentrations of ADMELOG after a Single Subcutaneous Administration of ADMELOG (0.3 unit/kg) in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes      The absolute bioavailability of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, after subcutaneous injection ranges from 55% to 77% with doses between 0.1 to 0.2 unit/kg, inclusive.      Figure 2               Distribution   When administered intravenously as bolus injections of 0.1 and 0.2 unit/kg dose in two separate groups of healthy subjects, the mean volume of distribution of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, appeared to decrease with increase in dose (1.55 and 0.72 L/kg, respectively).            Elimination          Metabolism  Human metabolism studies have not been conducted. However, animal studies indicate that the metabolism of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, is identical to that of regular human insulin.           Excretion  When administered intravenously, another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL demonstrated dose-dependent clearance, with a mean clearance of 21.0 mL/min/kg (0.1 unit/kg dose), and 9.6 mL/min/kg (0.2 unit/kg dose). Another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, demonstrated a mean t 1/2 of 0.85 hours (51 minutes) and 0.92 hours (55 minutes), respectively for 0.1 unit/kg and 0.2 unit/kg doses.              Specific Populations   The effects of age, gender, race, obesity, pregnancy, or smoking on the pharmacokinetics of ADMELOG have not been studied.         Patients with renal impairment  Type 2 diabetic patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed no difference in pharmacokinetics of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL. However, the sensitivity of the patients to insulin did change, with an increased response to insulin as the renal function declined. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with renal impairment. Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin, including ADMELOG, may be necessary in patients with renal dysfunction.           Patients with hepatic impairment  Type 2 diabetic patients with impaired hepatic function showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of another insulin lispro product, 100 units/mL, as compared to patients with no hepatic dysfunction. However, some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with liver failure. Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin, including ADMELOG, may be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction.</Section>
