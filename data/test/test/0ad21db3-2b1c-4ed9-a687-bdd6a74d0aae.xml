    <Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">Individualize dosage based on metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring, glycemic control, type of diabetes, prior insulin use. ( 2.2 ,  2.3 ,  2.4 )
  Administer subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, but at the same time every day. ( 2.2 )
  Rotate injection sites to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. ( 2.1 )
  Closely monitor glucose when converting to BASAGLAR and during initial weeks thereafter. ( 2.2 )
  Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. ( 2.1 )
            Always check insulin labels before administration  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] .
  Train patients on proper use and injection technique before initiating BASAGLAR.
  Visually inspect BASAGLAR KwikPen for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Only use if the solution is clear and colorless with no visible particles.
   Inject between 1 and 80 units per injection.
									  Administer BASAGLAR subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid, and rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy  [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] .
  Use BASAGLAR with caution in patients with visual impairment that may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose.
  Do not dilute or mix BASAGLAR with any other insulin or solution as the onset of action or time to peak effect of BASAGLAR and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner.
  Do not administer intravenously or via an insulin pump because this could result in severe hypoglycemia.
             In patients with type 1 diabetes, BASAGLAR must be used concomitantly with short-acting insulin.
  Inject BASAGLAR subcutaneously once daily at any time of day but at the same time every day.
  Individualize and titrate the dosage of BASAGLAR based on the individual's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal.
  Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), during acute illness, or changes in renal or hepatic function and should be made under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] .
  The BASAGLAR KwikPen dials in 1 unit increments.
             The recommended starting dose of BASAGLAR in patients with type 1 diabetes should be approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Short- or rapid-acting, pre-meal insulin should be used to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements.
  The recommended starting dose of BASAGLAR in patients with type 2 diabetes is 0.2 units/kg or up to 10 units once daily. One may need to adjust the amount and timing of short- or rapid-acting insulins and dosages of any anti-diabetic drugs.
             If changing patients from another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, to BASAGLAR, the dose of BASAGLAR should be the same as the other insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, and the time of day for administration should be determined by the physician.
  If changing patients from a once-daily insulin glargine product, 300 units/mL, to once-daily BASAGLAR, the recommended initial BASAGLAR dosage is 80% of the insulin glargine product, 300 units/mL, dose that is being discontinued. This dosage reduction will lower the likelihood of hypoglycemia  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] .
  If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate- or long-acting insulin (other than an insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL) to a regimen with BASAGLAR, a change in the dose of the basal insulin may be required and the amount and timing of shorter-acting insulins and doses of any anti-diabetic drugs may need to be adjusted.
  If changing patients from twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily BASAGLAR, the recommended initial BASAGLAR dosage is 80% of the total NPH dosage that is being discontinued. This dosage reduction will lower the likelihood of hypoglycemia  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] .</Section>
    <Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">Table 6 includes clinically significant drug interactions with BASAGLAR
   Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with BASAGLAR
       Drugs That May Increase the Risk of Hypoglycemia      Drugs:   Antidiabetic agents, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, pentoxifylline, pramlintide, propoxyphene, salicylates, somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide), and sulfonamide antibiotics.
     Intervention:   Dose reductions and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when BASAGLAR is co-administered with these drugs.
     Drugs That May Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of BASAGLAR      Drugs:   Atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine and clozapine), corticosteroids, danazol, diuretics, estrogens, glucagon, isoniazid, niacin, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., albuterol, epinephrine, terbutaline), and thyroid hormones
     Intervention:   Dose increases and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when BASAGLAR is co-administered with these drugs.
     Drugs That May Increase or Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of BASAGLAR      Drugs:   Alcohol, beta-blockers, clonidine, and lithium salts. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia.
     Intervention:   Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when BASAGLAR is co-administered with these drugs.
     Drugs That May Blunt Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia      Drugs:   beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine
     Intervention:   Increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when BASAGLAR is co-administered with these drugs.
            Drugs that affect glucose metabolism: Adjustment of insulin dosage may be needed; closely monitor blood glucose. ( 7 )
   Anti-Adrenergic Drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine): Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent. ( 7 )</Section>
    <Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">Never share a BASAGLAR KwikPen between patients, even if the needle is changed. ( 5.1 )
   Hyper- or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision. ( 5.2 )
   Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, co-administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness. ( 5.3 ,  6.1 )
   Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. ( 5.4 )
   Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue BASAGLAR, monitor and treat if indicated. ( 5.5 ,  6.1 )
   Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. ( 5.6 )
   Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs. ( 5.7 )
           BASAGLAR KwikPens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.
           Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and only under close medical supervision, and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed.
           Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including BASAGLAR  [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). BASAGLAR, or any insulin, should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia  [see Contraindications ( 4 )] .
  Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers)  [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.
          Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia   The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of BASAGLAR may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature  [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . The risk of hypoglycemia generally increases with intensity of glycemic control. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication  [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia  [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ,  8.7 )] .
            Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia   Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.
  The long-acting effect of BASAGLAR may delay recovery from hypoglycemia.
             Accidental mix-ups between insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, and other insulins, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been reported. To avoid medication errors between BASAGLAR and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.
           Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including BASAGLAR. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue BASAGLAR; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve  [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . BASAGLAR is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or one of the excipients  [see Contraindications ( 4 )] .
           All insulin products, including BASAGLAR, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations).
           Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including BASAGLAR, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.</Section>
    <Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analog lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.
           The pharmacodynamic profile for BASAGLAR was determined after subcutaneous administration of a single 0.5 U/kg dose in a euglycemic clamp study conducted in 91 healthy subjects. The median time to maximum effect of BASAGLAR (measured by the peak rate of glucose infusion) was approximately 12.0 hours. The pharmacodynamic profile of BASAGLAR following subcutaneous injection demonstrated sustained glucose lowering activity over 24 hours with no pronounced peak. The mean area under the glucose infusion rate curves (measure of overall pharmacodynamic effect) and maximum glucose infusion rate were 1670 mg/kg and 2.12 mg/kg/min, respectively.
  A euglycemic clamp study in 20 patients with type 1 diabetes showed a similar pharmacodynamic profile with a sustained glucose lowering activity over 24 hours following a single 0.3 U/kg subcutaneous dose of BASAGLAR.
  After subcutaneous injection of 0.3 units/kg of another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, in patients with type 1 diabetes, the duration of action after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh subcutaneous administration was similar.
  The time course of action of insulins, including insulin glargine, may vary between individuals and within the same individual.
                 Absorption and Bioavailability   The pharmacokinetic profile for BASAGLAR was determined after subcutaneous administration of  a single 0.5 U/kg dose in a euglycemic clamp study conducted in 91 healthy subjects. The insulin serum concentrations indicated a slow and prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak. The median time to maximum serum insulin concentration was 12 hours after injection. On average, serum insulin concentrations declined to baseline by approximately 24 hours. The mean observed area under the serum insulin concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours and peak serum insulin concentration were 1720 pmol*hr/L and 103 pmol/L, respectively.
            Metabolism and Elimination   After subcutaneous injection of another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, in diabetic patients, insulin glargine is metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the Beta chain with formation of two active metabolites M1 (21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 (21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). The in vitro activity of M1 and M2 were similar to that of insulin.
            Specific Populations    Age, Race, and Gender: Effect of age, race, and gender on the pharmacokinetics of BASAGLAR has not been evaluated.
   Obesity: Effect of BMI on the pharmacokinetics of BASAGLAR has not been evaluated.</Section>
