    <Section name="BOXED WARNING SECTION" id="34066-1">Renal Failure     JADENU can cause acute renal failure and death, particularly in patients with comorbidities and those who are in the advanced stages of their hematologic disorders.     Evaluate baseline renal function prior to starting or increasing JADENU dosing in all patients. JADENU is contraindicated in adult and pediatric patients with eGFR less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Measure serum creatinine in duplicate prior to initiation of therapy. Monitor renal function at least monthly. For patients with baseline renal impairment or increased risk of acute renal failure, monitor renal function weekly for the first month, then at least monthly. Reduce the starting dose in patients with preexisting renal disease. During therapy, increase the frequency of monitoring and modify the dose for patients with an increased risk of renal impairment, including use of concomitant nephrotoxic drugs, and pediatric patients with volume depletion or overchelation  [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] .      Hepatic Failure     JADENU can cause hepatic injury including hepatic failure and death.     Measure serum transaminases and bilirubin in all patients prior to initiating treatment, every 2 weeks during the first month, and at least monthly thereafter.     Avoid use of JADENU in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment and reduce the dose in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .     Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage     JADENU can cause gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhages, which may be fatal, especially in elderly patients who have advanced hematologic malignancies and/or low platelet counts.    Monitor patients and discontinue JADENU for suspected GI ulceration or hemorrhage  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .          WARNING: RENAL FAILURE, HEPATIC FAILURE, AND GASTROINTESTINAL HEMORRHAGE     See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.    JADENU may cause serious and fatal:     acute kidney injury, including acute renal failure requiring dialysis and renal tubular toxicity including Fanconi syndrome ( 5.1 )     hepatic toxicity, including failure ( 5.2 )     gastrointestinal hemorrhage ( 5.3 )     JADENU therapy requires close patient monitoring, including laboratory tests of renal and hepatic function.

    <Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">Transfusional Iron Overload: Initial dose for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 is 14 mg per kg (calculated to nearest whole tablet or nearest whole sachet content for granules) once daily. ( 2.1 )  NTDT Syndromes: Initial dose for patients with eGFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 is 7 mg per kg (calculated to nearest whole tablet or nearest whole sachet content for granules) once daily. ( 2.2 )  See Full Prescribing information for information regarding monitoring, administration, and dose-reductions for organ impairment. ( 2.1 ,  2.2 ,  2.3 ,  2.4 )           JADENU therapy should only be considered when a patient has evidence of chronic transfusional iron overload. The evidence should include the transfusion of at least 100 mL/kg of packed red blood cells (e.g., at least 20 units of packed red blood cells for a 40 kg person or more in individuals weighing more than 40 kg), and a serum ferritin consistently greater than 1000 mcg/L.   Prior to starting therapy, or increasing dose, evaluate:    Serum ferritin level   Baseline renal function:   Obtain serum creatinine in duplicate (due to variations in measurements)  Calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Use a prediction equation appropriate for adult patients (e.g., CKD-EPI, MDRD method) and in pediatric patients (e.g., Schwartz equations).  Obtain urinalyses and serum electrolytes to evaluate renal tubular function  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .    Serum transaminases and bilirubin  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]   Baseline auditory and ophthalmic examinations  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]     Initiating Therapy:    The recommended initial dose of JADENU for patients 2 years of age and older with eGFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 is 14 mg per kg body weight orally, once daily. Calculate doses (mg per kg per day) to the nearest whole tablet or nearest whole sachet content for granules. Changes in weight of pediatric patients over time must be taken into account when calculating the dose.    During Therapy:    Monitor serum ferritin monthly and adjust the dose of JADENU, if necessary, every 3 to 6 months based on serum ferritin trends.   Use the minimum effective dose to achieve a trend of decreasing ferritin   Make dose adjustments in steps of 3.5 or 7 mg per kg and tailor adjustments to the individual patient’s response and therapeutic goals.  In patients not adequately controlled with doses of 21 mg per kg (e.g., serum ferritin levels persistently above 2500 mcg/L and not showing a decreasing trend over time), doses of up to 28 mg per kg may be considered. Doses above 28 mg per kg are not recommended  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] .   Adjust dose based on serum ferritin levels    If the serum ferritin falls below 1000 mcg/L at 2 consecutive visits, consider dose reduction, especially if the JADENU dose is greater than 17.5 mg/kg/day  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .  If the serum ferritin falls below 500 mcg/L, interrupt JADENU therapy and continue monthly monitoring.   Evaluate the need for ongoing chelation therapy for patients whose conditions no longer require regular blood transfusions.  Use the minimum effective dose to maintain iron burden in the target range  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] .     Monitor blood counts, liver function, renal function and ferritin monthly  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)] .    Interrupt JADENU for pediatric patients who have acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor more frequently. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .             JADENU therapy should only be considered when a patient with NTDT syndrome has an LIC of at least 5 mg Fe/g dw and a serum ferritin greater than 300 mcg/L.
								  Prior to starting therapy, obtain:
								   LIC by liver biopsy or by an FDA-cleared or approved method for identifying patients for treatment with deferasirox therapy
									  Serum ferritin level on at least 2 measurements 1-month apart  [see Clinical Studies (14)]
										    Baseline renal function:   Obtain serum creatinine in duplicate (due to variations in measurements)
											  Calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Use a prediction equation appropriate for adult patients (e.g., CKD-EPI, MDRD method) and in pediatric patients (e.g., Schwartz equations).  Obtain urinalyses and serum electrolytes to evaluate renal tubular function  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].     Serum transaminases and bilirubin  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]   Baseline auditory and ophthalmic examinations  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]
										     Initiating Therapy:    The recommended initial dose of JADENU for patients with eGFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 is 7 mg per kg body weight orally once daily. Calculate doses (mg per kg per day) to the nearest whole tablet or nearest whole sachet content for granules. 
									  If the baseline LIC is greater than 15 mg Fe/g dw, consider increasing the dose to 14 mg/kg/day after 4 weeks.
									    During Therapy:    Monitor serum ferritin monthly. Interrupt treatment when serum ferritin is less than 300 mcg/L and obtain an LIC to determine whether the LIC has fallen to less than 3 mg Fe/g dw.
									   Use the minimum effective dose to achieve a trend of decreasing ferritin.   Monitor LIC every 6 months.
									  After 6 months of therapy, if the LIC remains greater than 7 mg Fe/g dw, increase the dose of deferasirox to a maximum of 14 mg/kg/day. Do not exceed a maximum of 14 mg/kg/day.
									  If after 6 months of therapy, the LIC is 3 to 7 mg Fe/g dw, continue treatment with deferasirox at no more than 7 mg/kg/day.
									  When the LIC is less than 3 mg Fe/g dw, interrupt treatment with deferasirox and continue to monitor the LIC. 
									   Monitor blood counts, liver function, renal function and ferritin monthly  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)] .    Increase monitoring frequency for pediatric patients who have acute illness which can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake. Consider dose interruption until oral intake and volume status are normal  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .    Restart treatment when the LIC rises again to more than 5 mg Fe/g dw.
								           Swallow JADENU tablets once daily with water or other liquids, preferably at the same time each day. Take JADENU tablets on an empty stomach or with a light meal (contains less than 7% fat content and approximately 250 calories). Examples of light meals include 1 whole wheat English muffin, 1 packet jelly (0.5 ounces), and skim milk (8 fluid ounces) or a turkey sandwich (2 oz. turkey on whole wheat bread w/ lettuce, tomato, and 1 packet mustard). Do not take JADENU tablets with aluminum-containing antacid products  [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . For patients who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets, JADENU tablets may be crushed and mixed with soft foods (e.g., yogurt or applesauce) immediately prior to use and administered orally. Commercial crushers with serrated surfaces should be avoided for crushing a single 90 mg tablet. The dose should be immediately and completely consumed and not stored for future use.
								  Take JADENU Sprinkle granules on an empty stomach or with a light meal   [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Administer JADENU Sprinkle granules by sprinkling the full dose on soft food (e.g., yogurt or applesauce) immediately prior to use and administered orally. JADENU Sprinkle granules should be taken once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Do not take JADENU Sprinkle granules with aluminum-containing antacid products   [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] .
								  For patients who are currently on chelation therapy with Exjade tablets for oral suspension and converting to JADENU, the dose should be about 30% lower, rounded to the nearest whole tablet or nearest whole sachet content for granules. The table below provides additional information on dosing conversion to JADENU.
								           EXJADE Tablets for oral suspension (white round tablet)    JADENU Tablets (film coated blue oval tablet) JADENU Sprinkle Granules (white to almost white granules)      Transfusion-Dependent  Iron Overload     Starting Dose   20 mg/kg/day   14 mg/kg/day     Titration Increments  5–10 mg/kg   3.5–7 mg/kg     Maximum Dose  40 mg/kg/day  28 mg/kg/day     Non-Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia Syndromes     Starting Dose   10 mg/kg/day   7 mg/kg/day     Titration Increments  5–10 mg/kg   3.5–7 mg/kg     Maximum Dose  20 mg/kg/day  14 mg/kg/day               Patients with Baseline Hepatic Impairment   Mild (Child-Pugh A) Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary.   Moderate (Child-Pugh B) Hepatic Impairment: Reduce the starting dose by 50%.  Severe (Child-Pugh C) Hepatic Impairment: Avoid JADENU tablets or JADENU Sprinkle granules  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] .   Patients with Baseline Renal Impairment    Do not use JADENU in adult or pediatric patients with eGFR less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2  [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Contraindications (4)] .    For patients with renal impairment (eGFR 40-60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), reduce the starting dose by 50%  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] .    Exercise caution in pediatric patients with eGFR between 40 and 60 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 . If treatment is needed, use the minimum effective dose and monitor renal function frequently. Individualize dose titration based on improvement in renal injury  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] .             JADENU is contraindicated in patients with eGFR less than 40 mL/minute/1.73 m 2  [see Contraindications (4)].     For decreases in renal function while receiving JADENU  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] , modify the dose as follows:    Transfusional Iron Overload
									    Adults:    If the serum creatinine increases by 33% or more above the average baseline measurement, repeat the serum creatinine within 1 week, and if still elevated by 33% or more, reduce the dose by 7 mg per kg.    Pediatric Patients (ages 2 years–17 years):     Reduce the dose by 7 mg per kg if eGFR decreases by greater than 33% below the average baseline measurement and repeat eGFR within 1 week    Interrupt JADENU for acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor more frequently. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal. Avoid use of other nephrotoxic drugs  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .    In the setting of decreased renal function, evaluate the risk benefit profile of continued JADENU use. Use the minimum effective JADENU dose and monitor renal function more frequently, by evaluating tubular and glomerular function. Titrate dosing based on renal injury. Consider dose reduction or interruption and less nephrotoxic therapies until improvement of renal function. If signs of renal tubular or glomerular injury occur in the presence of other risk factors such as volume depletion, reduce or interrupt JADENU to prevent severe and irreversible renal injury  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .     All Patients (regardless of age):     Discontinue therapy for eGFR less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2  [see Contraindications (4)] .     Non-Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia Syndromes
									    Adults:    If the serum creatinine increases by 33% or more above the average baseline measurement, repeat the serum creatinine within 1 week, and if still elevated by 33% or more, interrupt therapy if the dose is 3.5 mg per kg, or reduce by 50% if the dose is 7 or 14 mg per kg.
									    Pediatric Patients (ages 10 years – 17 years):     Reduce the dose by 3.5 mg per kg if eGFR decreases by greater than 33% below the average baseline measurement and repeat the eGFR within 1 week.    Increase monitoring frequency for pediatric patients who have acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake. Consider dose interruption until oral intake and volume status are normal. Avoid use of other nephrotoxic drugs  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .    In the setting of decreased renal function, evaluate the risk benefit profile of continued JADENU use. Use the minimum effective JADENU dose and monitor renal function more frequently, by evaluating tubular and glomerular function. Titrate dosing based on renal injury. Consider dose reduction or interruption and less nephrotoxic therapies until improvement of renal function. If signs of renal tubular or glomerular injury occur in the presence of other risk factors such as volume depletion, reduce or interrupt JADENU to prevent severe and irreversible renal injury  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .     All Patients (regardless of age):
									     Discontinue therapy for eGFR less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2  [see Contraindications (4)] .
										              UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) Inducers   Concomitant use of UGT inducers decreases systemic exposure. Avoid the concomitant use of strong UGT inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir). If you must administer JADENU tablets or JADENU Sprinkle granules with a strong UGT inducer, consider increasing the initial dose by 50%, and monitor serum ferritin levels and clinical responses for further dose modification  [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2), Drug Interactions (7.5)] .   Bile Acid Sequestrants   Concomitant use of bile acid sequestrants decreases systemic exposure. Avoid the concomitant use of bile acid sequestrants (e.g., cholestyramine, colesevelam, colestipol). If you must administer JADENU tablets or JADENU Sprinkle granules with a bile acid sequestrant, consider increasing the initial dose by 50%, and monitor serum ferritin levels and clinical responses for further dose modification  [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2), Drug Interactions (7.6)] .</Section>
    <Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">Avoid the use of JADENU with aluminum-containing antacid preparations. ( 7.1 )  Deferasirox increases the exposure of repaglinide. Consider repaglinide dose reduction and monitor blood glucose levels. ( 7.3 )  Avoid the use of JADENU with theophylline as theophylline levels could be increased. ( 7.4 )
									  Deferasirox increases exposure of busulfan. Monitor plasma concentrations of busulfan when coadministered with deferasirox to allow dose adjustment of busulfan, as needed. ( 7.7 )
									           The concomitant administration of JADENU and aluminum-containing antacid preparations has not been formally studied. Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminum than for iron, avoid use of JADENU with aluminum-containing antacid preparations.           Deferasirox may induce CYP3A4 resulting in a decrease in CYP3A4 substrate concentration when these drugs are coadministered. Closely monitor patients for signs of reduced effectiveness when deferasirox is administered with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., alfentanil, aprepitant, budesonide, buspirone, conivaptan, cyclosporine, darifenacin, darunavir, dasatinib, dihydroergotamine, dronedarone, eletriptan, eplerenone, ergotamine, everolimus, felodipine, fentanyl, hormonal contraceptive agents, indinavir, fluticasone, lopinavir, lovastatin, lurasidone, maraviroc, midazolam, nisoldipine, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, saquinavir, sildenafil, simvastatin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, tolvaptan, tipranavir, triazolam, ticagrelor, and vardenafil)  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .           Deferasirox inhibits CYP2C8 resulting in an increase in CYP2C8 substrate (e.g., repaglinide and paclitaxel) concentration when these drugs are coadministered.  If JADENU and repaglinide are used concomitantly, consider decreasing the dose of repaglinide and perform careful monitoring of blood glucose levels. Closely monitor patients for signs of exposure related toxicity when JADENU is coadministered with other CYP2C8 substrates  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].            Deferasirox inhibits CYP1A2 resulting in an increase in CYP1A2 substrate (e.g., alosetron, caffeine, duloxetine, melatonin, ramelteon, tacrine, theophylline, tizanidine) concentration when these drugs are coadministered. An increase in theophylline plasma concentrations could lead to clinically significant theophylline induced CNS or other adverse reactions.  Avoid the concomitant use of theophylline or other CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., tizanidine) with JADENU.  Monitor theophylline concentrations and consider theophylline dose modification if you must coadminister theophylline with JADENU. Closely monitor patients for signs of exposure related toxicity when JADENU is coadministered with other drugs metabolized by CYP1A2  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .           Deferasirox is a substrate of UGT1A1 and to a lesser extent UGT1A3. The concomitant use of JADENU with strong UGT inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) may result in a decrease in JADENU efficacy due to a possible decrease in deferasirox concentration. Avoid the concomitant use of strong UGT inducers with JADENU. Consider increasing the initial dose of JADENU if you must coadminister these agents together  [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .           Avoid the concomitant use of bile acid sequestrants (e.g., cholestyramine, colesevelam, colestipol) with JADENU due to a possible decrease in deferasirox concentration.  If you must coadminister these agents together, consider increasing the initial dose of JADENU  [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .           Increased exposure of busulfan was observed with concomitant use with deferasirox. Monitor plasma concentrations of busulfan when coadministered with deferasirox to allow dose adjustment of busulfan as needed   [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .</Section>
    <Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">Acute Kidney Injury: Measure serum creatinine in duplicate before starting therapy. Monitor renal function during JADENU therapy and reduce dose or interrupt therapy for toxicity. ( 2.1 ,  2.4 ,  5.1 )  Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function. Reduce dose or interrupt therapy for toxicity. ( 5.2 )  Fatal and Nonfatal Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Irritation: Risk may be greater in patients who are taking JADENU in combination with drugs that have known ulcerogenic or hemorrhagic potential. ( 5.3 )  Bone Marrow Suppression: Neutropenia, agranulocytosis, worsening anemia, and thrombocytopenia, including fatal events; monitor blood counts during JADENU therapy. Interrupt therapy for toxicity. ( 5.4 )  Age-related Risk of Toxicity: Monitor elderly and pediatric patients closely for toxicity. ( 5.5 )  Hypersensitivity Reactions: Discontinue JADENU for severe reactions and institute medical intervention. ( 5.7 )  Severe Skin Reactions including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS): Discontinue JADENU. ( 5.8 )            JADENU is contraindicated in patients with eGFR less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Exercise caution in pediatric patients with eGFR between 40 and 60 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 . If treatment is needed, use the minimum effective dose and monitor renal function frequently. Individualize dose titration based on improvement in renal injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. For patients with renal impairment (eGFR 40-60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) reduce the starting dose by 50%  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] .    JADENU can cause acute kidney injury including renal failure requiring dialysis that has resulted in fatal outcomes. Based on postmarketing experience, most fatalities have occurred in patients with multiple comorbidities and who were in advanced stages of their hematological disorders. In the clinical trials, adults and pediatric deferasirox-treated patients with no preexisting renal disease experienced dose-dependent mild, non-progressive increases in serum creatinine and proteinuria. Preexisting renal disease and concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs may increase the risk of acute kidney injury in adult and pediatric patients. Acute illnesses associated with volume depletion and overchelation may increase the risk of acute kidney injury in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients, small decreases in eGFR can result in increases in deferasirox exposure, particularly in younger patients with body surface area typical of patients less than age 7 years. This can lead to a cycle of worsening renal function and further increases in Exjade exposure, unless the dose is reduced or interrupted. Renal tubular toxicity, including acquired Fanconi syndrome, has been reported in patients treated with deferasirox, most commonly in pediatric patients with beta-thalassemia and serum ferritin levels less than 1,500 mcg/L  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2), Use in Special Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .    Evaluate renal glomerular and tubular function before initiating therapy or increasing the dose. Use prediction equations validated for use in adult and pediatric patients to estimate GFR. Obtain serum electrolytes and urinalysis in all patients to evaluate renal tubular function  [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)] .    Monitor all patients for changes in eGFR and for renal tubular toxicity weekly during the first month after initiation or modification of therapy and at least monthly thereafter. Monitor serum ferritin monthly to evaluate for overchelation. Use the minimum dose to establish and maintain a low iron burden. Monitor renal function more frequently in patients with preexisting renal disease or decreased renal function. In pediatric patients, interrupt JADENU during acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor renal function more frequently. Promptly correct fluid deficits to prevent renal injury. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal  [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] .            JADENU can cause hepatic injury, fatal in some patients. In Study 1, 4 patients (1.3%) discontinued deferasirox  because of hepatic toxicity (drug-induced hepatitis in 2 patients and increased serum transaminases in 2 additional patients). Hepatic toxicity appears to be more common in patients greater than 55 years of age. Hepatic failure was more common in patients with significant comorbidities, including liver cirrhosis and multiorgan failure  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .   Acute liver injury and failure, including fatal outcomes, have occurred in pediatric deferasirox-treated patients. Liver failure occurred in association with acute kidney injury in pediatric patients at risk for overchelation during a volume-depleting event. Interrupt JADENU therapy when acute liver injury or acute kidney injury is suspected and during volume depletion. Monitor liver and renal function more frequently in pediatric patients who are receiving JADENU in the 14-28 mg/kg/day range and when iron burden is approaching normal. Use the minimum effective dose to achieve and maintain a low iron burden  [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .   Measure transaminases (AST and ALT) and bilirubin in all patients before the initiation of treatment and every 2 weeks during the first month and at least monthly thereafter. Consider dose modifications or interruption of treatment for severe or persistent elevations.  Avoid the use of JADENU in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Reduce the starting dose in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . Patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment may be at higher risk for hepatic toxicity.           GI hemorrhage, including deaths, has been reported, especially in elderly patients who had advanced hematologic malignancies and/or low platelet counts. Nonfatal upper GI irritation, ulceration and hemorrhage have been reported in patients, including children and adolescents, receiving deferasirox  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Monitor for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and hemorrhage during JADENU therapy, and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. The risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage may be increased when administering JADENU in combination with drugs that have ulcerogenic or hemorrhagic potential, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, oral bisphosphonates, or anticoagulants. There have been reports of ulcers complicated with gastrointestinal perforation (including fatal outcome)  [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] .           Neutropenia, agranulocytosis, worsening anemia, and thrombocytopenia, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated with deferasirox. Preexisting hematologic disorders may increase this risk. Monitor blood counts in all patients. Interrupt treatment with JADENU in patients who develop cytopenias until the cause of the cytopenia has been determined. JADENU is contraindicated in patients with platelet counts below 50 x 10 9 /L.
								            Elderly Patients    JADENU has been associated with serious and fatal adverse reactions in the postmarketing setting among adults, predominantly in elderly patients. Monitor elderly patients treated with JADENU more frequently for toxicity  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] .    Pediatric Patients    JADENU has been associated with serious and fatal adverse reactions in pediatric patients in the postmarketing setting. These events were frequently associated with volume depletion or with continued Exjade doses in the 20-40 mg/kg/day range equivalent to 14-28 mg/kg/day JADENU when body iron burden was approaching or in the normal range. Interrupt JADENU in patients with volume depletion, and resume JADENU when renal function and fluid volume have normalized. Monitor liver and renal function more frequently during volume depletion and in patients receiving JADENU in the 14-28 mg/kg/day range when iron burden is approaching the normal range. Use the minimum effective dose to achieve and maintain a low iron burden  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] .             For patients with transfusional iron overload, measure serum ferritin monthly to assess for possible overchelation of iron. An analysis of pediatric patients treated with Exjade in pooled clinical trials (n = 158), found a higher rate of renal adverse events among patients receiving doses greater than 25 mg/kg/day equivalent to 17.5 mg/kg/day JADENU while their serum ferritin values were less than 1000 mcg/L. Consider dose reduction or closer monitoring of renal and hepatic function, and serum ferritin levels during these periods. Use the minimum effective dose to maintain a low-iron burden  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] .    If the serum ferritin falls below 1000 mcg/L at 2 consecutive visits, consider dose reduction, especially if the JADENU dose is greater than 17.5 mg/kg/day  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . If the serum ferritin falls below 500 mcg/L, interrupt therapy with JADENU and continue monthly monitoring. Evaluate the need for ongoing chelation for patients whose conditions do not require regular blood transfusions. Use the minimum effective dose to maintain iron burden in the target range. Continued administration of JADENU in the 14 to 28 mg/kg/day range, when the body iron burden is approaching or within the normal range can result in life threatening adverse events  [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] .   For patients with NTDT, measure LIC by liver biopsy or by using an FDA-cleared or approved method for monitoring patients receiving deferasirox therapy every 6 months on treatment. Interrupt JADENU administration when the LIC is less than 3 mg Fe/g dw. Measure serum ferritin monthly, and if the serum ferritin falls below 300 mcg/L, interrupt JADENU and obtain a confirmatory LIC  [see Clinical Studies (14)] .           JADENU may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions (such as anaphylaxis and angioedema), with the onset of the reaction usually occurring within the first month of treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If reactions are severe, discontinue JADENU and institute appropriate medical intervention. JADENU is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to deferasirox products and should not be reintroduced in patients who have experienced previous hypersensitivity reactions on deferasirox products due to the risk of anaphylactic shock.            Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) which could be life-threatening or fatal have been reported during deferasirox therapy  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] . Cases of erythema multiforme have been observed. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions, and closely monitor. If any severe skin reactions are suspected, discontinue JADENU immediately and do not reintroduce JADENU therapy.            Rashes may occur during JADENU treatment  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . For rashes of mild to moderate severity, JADENU may be continued without dose adjustment, since the rash often resolves spontaneously. In severe cases, interrupt treatment with JADENU. Reintroduction at a lower dose with escalation may be considered after resolution of the rash.            Auditory disturbances (high frequency hearing loss, decreased hearing), and ocular disturbances (lens opacities, cataracts, elevations in intraocular pressure, and retinal disorders) were reported at a frequency of less than 1% with deferasirox therapy in the clinical studies. The frequency of auditory adverse events irrespective of causality was increased among pediatric patients, who received Exjade doses greater than 25 mg/kg/day equivalent to 17.5 mg/kg/day JADENU when serum ferritin was less than 1000 mcg/L  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] .   Perform auditory and ophthalmic testing (including slit lamp examinations and dilated fundoscopy) before starting JADENU treatment and thereafter at regular intervals (every 12 months). If disturbances are noted, monitor more frequently. Consider dose reduction or interruption.</Section>
    <Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">JADENU  (deferasirox) is an orally active chelator that is selective for iron (as Fe 3+ ). It is a tridentate ligand that binds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio. Although deferasirox has very low affinity for zinc and copper, there are variable decreases in the serum concentration of these trace metals after the administration of deferasirox. The clinical significance of these decreases is uncertain.           Pharmacodynamic effects tested in an iron balance metabolic study with the tablet for oral suspension formulation showed that deferasirox (10, 20, and 40 mg per kg per day) was able to induce a mean net iron excretion (0.119, 0.329, and 0.445 mg Fe/kg body weight per day, respectively) within the clinically relevant range (0.1 to 0.5 mg per kg per day). Iron excretion was predominantly fecal.  An analysis of pooled pediatric clinical trial data found a statistically significant relationship between exposure and the probability of renal toxicity (increase in serum creatinine and urinary protein), resulting in a decrease in renal function. Decreases in renal function resulted in an increase in deferasirox exposure which may increase the probability of renal toxicity.   Cardiac Electrophysiology   At the maximum approved recommended dose, deferasirox does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.            Absorption   Based on studies in patients with the tablet for oral suspension, deferasirox is absorbed following oral administration with median times to maximum plasma concentration (T max ) of about 1.5 to 4 hours. In healthy subjects, JADENU showed comparable T max . The maximal concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC 0-24h , AUC τ ) of deferasirox increase approximately linearly with dose after both single administration and under steady-state conditions. Exposure to deferasirox increased by an accumulation factor of 1.3 to 2.3 after multiple doses with the tablet for oral suspension formulation.    Tablets   The absolute bioavailability [as measured by area under the curve over time to infinity (AUC inf )] of deferasirox tablets for oral suspension is 70% compared to an intravenous dose. The bioavailability (as measured by AUCinf) of JADENU tablets was 36% greater than with deferasirox tablets for oral suspension. After strength-adjustment, the mean AUC inf of JADENU tablets (i.e., 360 mg strength) was similar to that of deferasirox tablets for oral suspension (i.e., 500 mg strength) under fasting conditions; however the mean C max was increased by 30%. The 30% increase in C max observed with JADENU tablets is not clinically meaningful.  The administration of JADENU tablets with a light meal (approximately 250 calories with fat content less than 7% of total calories) indicated that the AUC inf and C max were similar to that under fasting conditions. The administration of JADENU tablets with a high-fat meal (approximately 1000 calories with fat content greater than 50% of total calories), increased AUC inf by 18% and C max by 29% compared to that under fasting conditions  [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] .   Granules   The bioavailability (as measured by AUC inf ) of JADENU Sprinkle granules was 52% greater than with deferasirox tablets for oral suspension. After strength-adjustment, the mean AUC inf of the JADENU Sprinkle granules (i.e., 4 x 90 mg strength) was similar to that of deferasirox tablets for oral suspension (i.e., 500 mg strength) under fasting conditions; however, the mean C max was increased by 34%. The 34% increase in C max observed with JADENU Sprinkle granules is not clinically meaningful.  The administration of JADENU Sprinkle granules with a soft meal (e.g., yogurt and applesauce) or with a low-fat (approximately 450 calories with fat content approximately 30% of total calories) indicated that the AUC inf and C max after a low-fat meal or soft foods were similar to that under fasting conditions. The administration of JADENU Sprinkle granules with a high-fat meal (approximately 1000 calories with fat content greater than 50% of total calories) increased AUC inf by 18% with no changes in Cmax compared to that under fasting conditions  [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] .   Distribution   Deferasirox is highly (~99%) protein bound almost exclusively to serum albumin. The percentage of deferasirox confined to the blood cells was 5% in humans. The volume of distribution at steady state (V ss ) of deferasirox is 14.37 ± 2.69 L in adults.   Metabolism   Glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway for deferasirox, with subsequent biliary excretion. Deconjugation of glucuronidates in the intestine and subsequent reabsorption (enterohepatic recycling) is likely to occur. Deferasirox is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and to a lesser extent UGT1A3. CYP450-catalyzed (oxidative) metabolism of deferasirox appears to be minor in humans (about 8%). Deconjugation of glucuronide metabolites in the intestine and subsequent reabsorption (enterohepatic recycling) was confirmed in a healthy subjects study in which the administration of cholestyramine 12 g twice daily (strongly binds to deferasirox and its conjugates) 4 and 10 hours after a single dose of deferasirox resulted in a 45% decrease in deferasirox exposure (AUC inf ) by interfering with the enterohepatic recycling of deferasirox.    Excretion   Deferasirox and metabolites are primarily (84% of the dose) excreted in the feces. Renal excretion of deferasirox and metabolites is minimal (8% of the dose). The mean elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) ranged from 8 to 16 hours following oral administration.   Drug Interactions    Midazolam: The concomitant administration of deferasirox tablets for oral suspension and CYP3A4 probe substrate midazolam resulted in a decrease of midazolam C max by 23% and AUC inf by 17%. In the clinical setting, this effect may be more pronounced, as the study was not adequately designed to conclusively assess the potential induction of CYP3A4 by deferasirox  [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] .   Repaglinide: The concomitant administration of deferasirox tablets for oral suspension (30 mg per kg/day for 4 days) and the CYP2C8 probe substrate repaglinide (single dose of 0.5 mg) increased repaglinide AUC inf to 2.3-fold and C max of 1.6-fold  [see Drug Interactions (7.3)] .   Theophylline: The concomitant administration of deferasirox tablets for oral suspension (repeated dose of 30 mg per kg/day) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 120 mg) resulted in an approximate doubling of the theophylline AUC inf and elimination half-life. The single dose C max was not affected, but an increase in theophylline C max is expected to occur with chronic dosing  [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] .   Rifampicin: The concomitant administration of deferasirox tablets for oral suspension (single dose of 30 mg per kg) and the strong uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) inducer rifampicin (600 mg per day for 9 days) decreased deferasirox AUC inf by 44%  [see Drug Interactions (7.5)] .   Cholestyramine : The concomitant administration of cholestyramine after a single dose of deferasirox tablets for oral suspension decreased deferasirox AUC inf by 45%  [see Drug Interactions (7.6)] .   Busulfan : Concomitant administration of deferasirox and busulfan resulted in an increase of busulfan exposure (AUC).   In vitro Studies :  Deferasirox inhibited human CYP2A6, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 in vitro.  Deferasirox is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein, MRP1 or MRP2.   Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations    Pediatric : Following oral administration of single or multiple doses, systemic exposure of adolescents and children to deferasirox was less than in adult patients. In children less than 6 years of age, systemic exposure was about 50% lower than in adults.   Sex : The apparent clearance is 17.5% lower in females compared to males.   Renal Impairment : Compared to patients with MDS and eGFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , patients with MDS and eGFR 40 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (n = 34) had approximately 50% higher mean deferasirox trough plasma concentrations.   Hepatic Impairment : In a single dose (20 mg/kg) study in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, deferasirox exposure was increased compared to patients with normal hepatic function. The average total (free and bound) AUC inf of deferasirox increased 16% in 6 patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) hepatic impairment, and 76% in 6 patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment compared to 6 patients with normal hepatic function. The impact of severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment was assessed in only 1 patient.</Section>
