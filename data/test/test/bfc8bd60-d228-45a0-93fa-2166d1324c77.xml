    <Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">For intravenous administration only. Do not administer intrathecally. ( 2.1 )   Administer intravenously at a rate of less than 16 mL per minute. ( 2.1 ,  5.1 )     Rescue After High-Dose Methotrexate Therapy    Rescue recommendations are based on a methotrexate dose of 12 grams/m 2 administered by intravenous infusion over 4 hours. Initiate rescue at 7.5 mg (approximately 5 mg/m 2 ) every 6 hours, 24 hours after beginning methotrexate infusion. ( 2.2 )  Continue until methotrexate level is below 5 x 10 -8 M (0.05 micromolar). Adjust dose if necessary based on methotrexate elimination; refer to Full Prescribing Information. ( 2.2 )     Methotrexate Overdosage or Impaired Methotrexate Elimination    Start as soon as possible after methotrexate overdosage, or within 24 hours of delayed methotrexate elimination. ( 2.3 )    Administer Levoleucovorin for injection 7.5 mg (approximately 5 mg/m 2 ) intravenously every 6 hours until methotrexate level is less than 10 -8 M (0.05 micromolar). ( 2.3 )               Levoleucovorin for injection is indicated for intravenous administration only.  Do not administer intrathecally.    Administer intravenously at a rate less than 16 mL (160 mg of levoleucovorin) per minute  [see Warnings and Precautions (   5.1   )]  .             The recommendations for Levoleucovorin for injection rescue are based on a methotrexate dose of 12 grams/m 2 administered by intravenous infusion over 4 hours (refer to methotrexate prescribing information that includes high-dose methotrexate regimens) in adult and pediatric patients. Twenty-four hours after starting the methotrexate infusion, initiate Levoleucovorin for injection rescue at a dose of 7.5 mg (approximately 5 mg/m 2 ) every 6 hours.   Monitor serum creatinine and methotrexate levels at least once daily. Continue Levoleucovorin for injection administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH 7.0 or greater) until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10 -8 M (0.05 micromolar). Adjust dosage or extend duration based on the guidelines in Table 1.    Table 1 Guidelines for Levoleucovorin for Injection Dosage and Administration        Clinical Situation    Laboratory Findings    Recommendation     Normal methotrexate elimination    Serum methotrexate level approximately    10 micromolar at 24 hours after administration, 1 micromolar at 48 hours, and less than 0.2 micromolar at 72 hours.   Administer 7.5 mg by intravenous infusion every          6 hours for 60 hours (10 doses starting 24 hours after start of methotrexate infusion).     Delayed late methotrexate elimination   Serum methotrexate level remaining above 0.2 micromolar at 72 hours, and more than 0.05 micromolar at 96 hours after administration.   Continue 7.5 mg by intravenous infusion every 6 hours, until methotrexate level is less than 0.05 micromolar.     Delayed early methotrexate elimination and/or evidence of acute renal injury*     Serum methotrexate level of 50 micromolar or more at 24 hours, or 5 micromolar or more at 48 hours after administration, OR   100% or greater increase in serum creatinine level at 24 hours after methotrexate administration (e.g., an increase from 0.5 mg/dL to a level of 1 mg/dL or more).      Administer 75 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 hours until methotrexate level is less than 1 micromolar; then   7.5 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 hours until methotrexate level is less than 0.05 micromolar.    * These patients are likely to develop reversible renal failure.  In addition to appropriate levoleucovorin for injection therapy, continue hydration and urinary alkalinization, and monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved.       Impaired  Methotrexate Elimination or Renal Impairment   Decreased methotrexate elimination or renal impairment which are clinically important but less severe than abnormalities described in Table 1 can occur following methotrexate administration.  If toxicity is observed, extend Levoleucovorin for injection rescue for an additional 24 hours (total of 14 doses over 84 hours) in subsequent courses.    Third  -  Space Fluid    Collection   and Other Causes of Delayed Methotrexate E  limination   Accumulation in a third-space fluid collection (i.e., ascites, pleural effusion), renal insufficiency, or inadequate hydration can cause delayed methotrexate elimination. Under such circumstances, higher doses of Levoleucovorin for injection or prolonged administration may be indicated.            Start Levoleucovorin for injection rescue in adult and pediatric patients as soon as possible after an overdosage of methotrexate or within 24 hours of methotrexate administration when there is impaired methotrexate elimination. As the time interval between methotrexate administration and Levoleucovorin for injection rescue increases, effectiveness of Levoleucovorin for injection in diminishing toxicity may decrease. Administer Levoleucovorin for injection 7.5 mg (approximately 5 mg/m 2 ) intravenously every 6 hours until the serum methotrexate level is less than 10 -8 M (0.05 micromolar).    Monitor serum creatinine and methotrexate levels at least every 24 hours. If 24-hour serum creatinine has increased 50% over baseline or if the 24-hour methotrexate level is greater than 5 x 10 -6 M or 48-hour level is greater than 9 x 10 -7 M, increase the dose of Levoleucovorin for injection to 50 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 hours until the methotrexate level is less than 10 -8 M. Continue concomitant hydration (3 L per day) and urinary alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate. Adjust the bicarbonate dose to maintain urine pH at 7.0 or greater.             Preparation    Reconstitute vial contents with 17.7 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to obtain a clear, colorless to yellowish solution (resultant concentration 10 mg/mL levoleucovorin).  Reconstitution with a sodium chloride solution with preservatives (e.g. benzyl alcohol) has not been studied.   Discard vial if particulate matter or discoloration is observed.   Dilute reconstituted solution immediately, to concentrations of 0.5 mg/mL to 5 mg/mL in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.    Storage    If necessary, store reconstituted solution for not more than 24 hours at room temperature.   Do not store reconstituted solution diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, for more than 24 hours at room temperature.   Do not store reconstituted solution diluted with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, for more than 4 hours at room temperature.    Administration    Inspect reconstituted solution in the vial for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.     Do not co-administer with other agents in the same admixture, due to risk of precipitation.    Administer intravenously at a rate less than 16 mL (160 mg of levoleucovorin) per minute  [see Warnings and Precautions  (   5.1   )] .</Section>

    <Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">Levoleucovorin is the pharmacologically active isomer of 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). Levoleucovorin does not require reduction by dihydrofolate reductase to participate in reactions utilizing folates as a source of “one-carbon” moieties. Administration of levoleucovorin counteracts the therapeutic and toxic effects of folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase.            In a crossover-design pharmacokinetic comparability study, healthy subjects received a single 2-hour infusion of either levoleucovorin (200 mg/m 2 ) or racemic  d,l -leucovorin (400 mg/m 2 ).  The 90% confidence intervals for the geometric mean ratios for both AUC 0-inf and C max were within the standard limit of 80-125% for both  l -leucovorin and  l -5-methyl-THF. The exposure to  l -leucovorin and 5-methyl-THF was comparable whether it was administered as levoleucovorin or as  d,l -leucovorin as shown in Table 3:   Table 3  Geometric Mean Pharmacokinetic Parameters          Parameter     l   -leucovorin     d,l   -leucovorin    5-methyl-THF-   l   -   leucovorin    5-methyl-THF-    d,l   -leucovorin     AUC 0-inf  (ng.h/mL)  30719  31296  52105  50137    C max  (ng.h/mL)  10895  11301  4930  4658      Distribution   The pharmacokinetics of levoleucovorin after intravenous administration of a 15 mg dose was studied in healthy male volunteers. After rapid intravenous administration, serum total tetrahydrofolate (total-THF) concentrations reached a mean peak of 1722 ng/mL. Serum (6S)-5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate concentrations reached a mean peak of 275 ng/mL and the mean time to peak was 0.9 hours.    Elimination   The mean terminal half-life for total-THF and (6S)-5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate was 5.1 and 6.8 hours, respectively.</Section>
