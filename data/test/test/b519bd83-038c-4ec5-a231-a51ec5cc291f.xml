    <Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">Never share needles or syringes with another person. ( 5.1 )
   Hyper- or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision and increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring. ( 5.2 )
   Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, co-administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or with hypoglycemia unawareness. ( 5.3 )
   Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. ( 5.4 )
   Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions : Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue HUMULIN R, monitor, and treat if indicated. ( 5.5 )
   Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia and treat if indicated. ( 5.6 )
   Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs. ( 5.7 )
           Patients using HUMULIN R vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.
           Changes in insulin, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, adjustments in concomitant anti-diabetic medications may be needed.
           Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulins, including HUMULIN R. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery).
  Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers)  [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.
          Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia   The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of HUMULIN R may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature  [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] .
  Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication  [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia  [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ,  8.7 )] .
            Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia   Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.
             Accidental mix-ups between HUMULIN R and other insulins have been reported. To avoid medication errors between HUMULIN R and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.
           Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with HUMULIN R  [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue HUMULIN R; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. HUMULIN R is contraindicated in patients who have had a hypersensitivity reaction to HUMULIN R or its excipients  [see Contraindications ( 4 )] .
           All insulin products, including HUMULIN R, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations).
           Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including HUMULIN R, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.</Section>
    <Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">The primary activity of insulin, including HUMULIN R, is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin lowers blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.
           The time course of insulin action (i.e., glucose lowering) may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual. With subcutaneous use, the pharmacologic effect of HUMULIN R begins approximately 30 minutes (range: 10 to 75 minutes) after administration of doses in the 0.05 to 0.4 units/kg range (Figure 1). The effect is maximal at approximately 3 hours (range: 20 minutes to 7 hours) and terminates after approximately 8 hours (range: 3 to 14 hours). In a study that administered 50 and 100 units doses subcutaneously to obese subjects, mean time of termination of effect was prolonged to approximately 18 hours (range approximately 12-24 hours).
   Figure 1: Mean Insulin Activity Versus Time Profile After Subcutaneous Injection of HUMULIN R (0.3 unit/kg) in Healthy Subjects.
   With intravenous use, the pharmacologic effect of HUMULIN R begins at approximately 10 to 15 minutes and terminates at a median time of approximately 4 hours (range: 2 to 6 hours) after administration of doses in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 units/kg.
  The intravenous administration of HUMULIN R was tested in 21 people with type 1 diabetes. During the 6-hour assessment phase patients received intravenous HUMULIN R at an initial dose of 0.5 units/hour, adjusted to maintain blood glucose concentrations near normoglycemia (100 to 160 mg/dL).
  The mean blood glucose levels during the assessment phase for patients on HUMULIN R therapy are summarized below in Table 2. All patients achieved near normoglycemia during the 6-hour assessment phase. The average time (± SE) required to attain near normoglycemia was 161 ± 14 minutes for HUMULIN R.

         Figure 1
                    Absorption — In healthy subjects given subcutaneous doses of HUMULIN R ranging from 0.05 to 0.4 unit/kg, mean peak serum levels occurred between 36 to 150 minutes after dosing. After subcutaneous administration of a single 12 unit dose (approximately 0.15 units/kg) to patients with type 1 diabetes, the median peak serum level occurred at approximately 2 hours (range: 20 minutes-6 hours). In a study that administered 50 units (0.4-0.6 unit/kg) and 100 units (0.8-1.3 unit/kg) doses subcutaneously to healthy obese subjects, median peak serum levels were prolonged to approximately 3 hours (range 1 to 8 hours). The absolute bioavailability after a single subcutaneous injection of HUMULIN R ranges from 48% to 89% in the 0.1 to 0.3 unit/kg dose range.
            Distribution — When HUMULIN R is administered intravenously at doses of 0.1 or 0.2 unit/kg, the mean volume of distribution ranges between 0.32 to 0.67 L/kg.
            Metabolism — The uptake and degradation of insulin occurs predominantly in liver, kidney, muscle, and adipocytes, with the liver being the major organ involved in the clearance of insulin.
            Excretion — After subcutaneous administration of HUMULIN R doses in the 0.05-0.4 unit/kg dose range, the median apparent half-life is approximately 1.5 hours (range: 40 minutes-7 hours). Mean apparent half-life of HUMULIN R after subcutaneous administration of higher doses (50 and 100 units) to healthy obese subjects was approximately 3.6 hours (range= 1.6-8.6 hours).
  When administered intravenously, HUMULIN R had a mean half-life of approximately 20 minutes at a 0.1 unit/kg dose and 1 hour at a 0.2 unit/kg dose.</Section>
