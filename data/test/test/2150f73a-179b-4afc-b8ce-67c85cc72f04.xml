											    Avoid coadministration where alternatives exist.  If coadministration cannot be avoided, double the daily dose using increments of 5 mg or less. Multiple increments may be required.   Resume the dose administered prior to inducer initiation, once an inducer is discontinued for 5 days.      TSC-Associated SEGA and TSC- Associated Partial-Onset Seizures 
											    Double the daily dose using increments of 5 mg or less. Multiple increments may be required.  Addition of another strong CYP3A4 inducer in a patient already receiving treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer may not require additional dosage modification.  Assess trough concentrations when initiating and discontinuing the inducer  [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)] .  Resume the dose administered before starting any inducer, once all inducers are discontinued for 5 days.                  Administer AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ at the same time each day.  Administer AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ consistently either with or without food  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .  If a dose of AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ is missed, it can be administered up to 6 hours after the time it is normally administered. After more than 6 hours, the dose should be skipped for that day. The next day, AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ should be administered at its usual time. Double doses should not be administered to make up for the dose that was missed.    AFINITOR    AFINITOR should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Do not break or crush tablets.

									           Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ in clinical trials, some cases were reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4% and up to 0.2%, respectively  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Fatal outcomes have been observed.  Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Consider opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms.  Continue AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ without dose alteration in patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis.   For Grade 2 to 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, withhold or permanently discontinue AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ based on severity  [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)] . Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose.            AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, or PJP) and viral infections (e.g., reactivation of hepatitis B virus) have occurred. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, or resulting in multisystem organ failure) or fatal. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections was up to 10% and up to 3%, respectively. The incidence of serious infections was reported at a higher frequency in patients &lt; 6 years of age  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] .   Complete treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ based on severity of infection  [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)] . 
								  Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required.            Hypersensitivity reactions to AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ have been observed and include anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, and angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment)  [see Contraindications (4)] . The incidence of Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions was up to 1%. Permanently discontinue AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ for the development of clinically significant hypersensitivity.            Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors with AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking AFINITOR with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor. Permanently discontinue AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ for angioedema.
								           Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, has occurred in patients treated with AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ at an incidence ranging from 44% to 78% across clinical trials. Grades 3-4 stomatitis was reported in 4% to 9% of patients  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Stomatitis most often occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment. When starting AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ, initiating dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution as a swish and spit mouthwash reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . If stomatitis does occur, mouthwashes and/or other topical treatments are recommended. Avoid alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme- containing products, as they may exacerbate the condition. Do not administer antifungal agents, unless fungal infection has been diagnosed.           Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have occurred in patients taking AFINITOR. Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 elevations of serum creatinine was up to 2% and up to 1%, respectively. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 proteinuria was up to 1% and up to 0.5%, respectively. Monitor renal function prior to starting AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ and annually thereafter. Monitor renal function at least every 6 months in patients who have additional risk factors for renal failure.           AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ delays wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound-related complications like wound dehiscence, wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele, and seroma. These wound-related complications may require surgical intervention. Exercise caution with the use of AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ in the peri-surgical period.           In the randomized hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer study (BOLERO-2), the incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last AFINITOR dose was 6% in patients ≥ 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients &lt; 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients ≥ 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients &lt; 65 years of age. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended  [see Dosage and Administration (2.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] .            Hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ at an incidence up to 75%, 86%, and 73%, respectively. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 15% and up to 0.4%, respectively  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . In non-diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose prior to starting AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ and annually thereafter. In diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor lipid profile prior to starting AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ and annually thereafter. When possible, achieve optimal glucose and lipid control prior to starting AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ. For Grade 3 to 4 metabolic events, withhold or permanently discontinue AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ based on severity  [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)] .             Anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients taking AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 16% and up to 2%, respectively  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Monitor complete blood count prior to starting AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ every 6 months for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ based on severity  [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)] .            The safety of immunization with live vaccines during AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ therapy has not been studied. Due to the potential increased risk of infection, avoid the use of live vaccines and close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines during treatment with AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ. Due to the potential increased risk of infection or reduced immune response with vaccination, complete the recommended childhood series of vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate.           Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action, AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the clinical dose of 10 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment with AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ and for 4 weeks after the last dose  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)] .</Section>
    <Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in  in vitro and/or  in vivo studies.  Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer.  In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner.  Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 ( TSC1, TSC2 ). Loss or inactivation of either  TSC1 or  TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the  TSC1 or the  TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function. Treatment with an mTOR inhibitor in animal models of mTOR dysregulation in the brain resulted in seizure suppression, prevention of the development of new-onset seizures, and prevention of premature death.            Exposure-Response Relationship   In patients with TSC-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), the magnitude of the reduction in SEGA volume was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration.  In patients with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures, the magnitude of the reduction in absolute seizure frequency was correlated with the everolimus trough concentration.   Cardiac Electrophysiology   In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of AFINITOR (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. AFINITOR at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval.            Absorption   After administration of AFINITOR in patients with advanced solid tumors, peak everolimus concentrations are reached 1 to 2 hours after administration of oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 70 mg. Following single doses, C max is dose-proportional with daily dosing between 5 mg and 10 mg. With single doses of 20 mg and higher, the increase in C max is less than dose-proportional; however, AUC shows dose-proportionality over the 5 mg to 70 mg dose range. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks following once-daily dosing.  In patients with TSC-associated SEGA, everolimus C min was approximately dose-proportional within the dose range from 1.35 mg/m 2 to 14.4 mg/m 2 .   Effect of Food: In healthy subjects, a high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced systemic exposure to AFINITOR 10 mg (as measured by AUC) by 22% and the peak blood concentration C max by 54%. Light-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced AUC by 32% and C max by 42%.  In healthy subjects who received 9 mg of AFINITOR DISPERZ, high-fat meals (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced everolimus AUC by 12% and C max by 60% and low-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced everolimus AUC by 30% and C max by 50%.   Relative Bioavailability: The AUC inf of everolimus was equivalent between AFINITOR DISPERZ and AFINITOR; the C max of everolimus in the AFINITOR DISPERZ dosage form was 20% to 36% lower than that of AFINITOR. The predicted trough concentrations at steady-state were similar after daily administration.   Distribution   The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given AFINITOR 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.   Elimination   The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours.
								   Metabolism: Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself.
								   Excretion: No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or feces.
								   Specific Populations   No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and age or sex in patients with cancer.
								   Patients with Renal Impairment: No significant influence of creatinine clearance (25 to 178 mL/min) was detected on oral clearance (CL/F) of everolimus.
								   Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Compared to normal subjects, there was a 1.8-fold, 3.2-fold, and 3.6-fold increase in AUC for subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively. In another study, the average AUC of everolimus in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) was twice that found in subjects with normal hepatic function  [see Dosage and Administration (2.10), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] .
								   Pediatric Patients: In patients with TSC-associated SEGA or TSC-associated partial-onset seizures, the mean C min values normalized to mg/m 2 dose in pediatric patients (&lt; 18 years of age) were lower than those observed in adults, suggesting that everolimus clearance adjusted to body surface area was higher in pediatric patients as compared to adults.
								   Race or Ethnicity: Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese patients had on average exposures that were higher than non-Japanese patients receiving the same dose. Oral clearance (CL/F) is on average 20% higher in Black patients than in White patients.   Drug Interaction Studies    Effect of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors on Everolimus: Everolimus exposure increased when AFINITOR was coadministered with:   ketoconazole (a P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 3.9- and 15-fold, respectively.
								  erythromycin (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2- and 4.4-fold, respectively.
								  verapamil (a P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) - C max and AUC increased by 2.3- and 3.5-fold, respectively.
								    Effect of CYP3A4 and P-gp Inducers on Everolimus: The coadministration of AFINITOR with rifampin, a P-gp and strong inducer of CYP3A4, decreased everolimus AUC by 63% and Cmax by 58% compared to AFINITOR alone  [see Dosage and Administration (2.12)] .   Effect of Everolimus on CYP3A4 Substrates: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between AFINITOR and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), pravastatin (a non-CYP3A4 substrate), and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate).  The coadministration of an oral dose of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with AFINITOR resulted in a 25% increase in midazolam C max and a 30% increase in midazolam AUC 0-inf .  The coadministration of AFINITOR with exemestane increased exemestane Cmin by 45% and C2 h by 64%; however, the corresponding estradiol levels at steady state (4 weeks) were not different between the 2 treatment arms. No increase in adverse reactions related to exemestane was observed in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer receiving the combination.  The coadministration of AFINITOR with long acting octreotide increased octreotide C min by approximately 50%.   Effect of Everolimus on Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs): Everolimus increased pre-dose concentrations of the carbamazepine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine, and clobazam’s metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by about 10%. Everolimus had no impact on pre-dose concentrations of AEDs that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., clonazepam and zonisamide) or other AEDs, including valproic acid, topiramate, phenobarbital, and phenytoin.</Section>
