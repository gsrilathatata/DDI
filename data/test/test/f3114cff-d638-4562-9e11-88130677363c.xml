Patients with known hypersensitivity to codeine, chlorpheniramine or any of the inactive ingredients of CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE.  Persons known to be hypersensitive to certain other opioids may exhibit cross-sensitivity to codeine.         • Post-operative pain management in children undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. (  4  )   • Patients with known hypersensitivity to codeine, chlorpheniramine, or any of the product components of CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE. (  4  )</Section>
    <Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">Adults and children 18 years of age and older: 1 tablet every 12 hours, not to exceed 2 doses in 24 hours. (  2.1 )            CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE should be administered orally at a dosage of one tablet every 12 hours, not to exceed 2 tablets in 24 hours.</Section>
    <Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">• Opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants: may cause additive CNS depression.  (7.1)    • MAOIs or tricyclic antidepressants: may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or codeine.  (7.2)    • Anticholinergic drugs: Use with caution. Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockage (e.g., xerostomia, blurred vision, or constipation) may occur.  (7.3)    • Inhibitors or inducers of metabolic enzymes: Concomitant use of cytochrome P450 2D6 and 3A4 enzyme inhibitors or inducers may result in an altered response to codeine, monitor antitussive activity. Chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin, monitor phenytoin toxicity.  (7.4)            The use of benzodiazepines, opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE may cause an additive CNS depressant effect, profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death and should be avoided. [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )].            Do not prescribe CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE if the patient is taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (i.e., certain drugs used for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, or Parkinson’s disease), or for 2 weeks after stopping a MAOI drug.  The use of MAOIs or tricyclic antidepressants with codeine preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or codeine.           Codeine and chlorpheniramine should be administered cautiously to persons receiving other anticholinergic drugs in order to avoid paralytic ileus and excessive anticholinergic effects.  Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade (e.g., xerostomia, blurred vision, or constipation) may occur when anticholinergic drugs are administered with chlorpheniramine .            Codeine is metabolized by the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes  [see  Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].  The concurrent use of drugs that preferentially induce codeine N-demethylation (via CYP3A4) may increase the plasma concentrations of codeine’s inactive metabolite norcodeine.  Drugs that inhibit codeine O-demethylation (via CYP2D6), may decrease the plasma concentration of codeine’s active metabolites, morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide. The contribution of these active metabolites to the overall antitussive effect of codeine is not known, but should be considered.    Adverse event reports in the literature suggest a possible drug interaction involving increased serum phenytoin levels and phenytoin toxicity when chlorpheniramine and phenytoin are co-administered.  The exact mechanism for this interaction is not known, however it is believed that chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin.  Patients should be monitored for evidence of phenytoin toxicity such as ataxia, hyperreflexia, nystagmus and tremor when these two drugs are co-administered.</Section>
    <Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">• Risk of death in ultra-rapid metabolizers: Conversion of codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, may occur more rapidly and completely resulting in higher than expected morphine levels and respiratory depression or death. ( 5.1 )   • Risks using with Benzodiazepines or other CNS Depressants. ( 5.2 )   • Dose-related respiratory depression. Use with caution. ( 5.3 )   • Drug dependence: Prescribe with caution that is appropriate to the use of other opioids. ( 5.4 )   • Head injury, intra-cranial lesions, or increased intracranial pressure: Avoid in patients with head injury, intra-cranial lesions, or increased intracranial pressure. ( 5.5 )   • Activities requiring mental alertness: Avoid engaging in hazardous tasks requiring complete mental alertness such as driving or operating machinery. Avoid concurrent use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants.. ( 5.6 )   • Prolonged use may cause Obstructive Bowel Disease ( 5.7 )   • Acute abdominal conditions: Use caution in patients with acute abdominal conditions. ( 5.8 )   • Special risk patients: Caution in elderly patients and those with asthma, persistent or chronic cough, hypothyroidism, Addison’s disease, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture. ( 5.9 )           Respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine in the post-operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy and had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine (i.e., multiple copies of the gene for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 or high morphine concentrations). Deaths have also occurred in nursing infants who were exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because their mothers were ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]   Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (gene duplications denoted as *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN). The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 0.5 to 1% in Chinese and Japanese, 0.5 to 1% in Hispanics, 1 to 10% in Caucasians, 3% in African Americans, and 16 to 28% in North Africans, Ethiopians, and Arabs. Data are not available for other ethnic groups. These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose (such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing).   [see  Overdosage (10) ]   Children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine that has been rapidly metabolized to morphine. CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE is contraindicated for post-operative pain management in all pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy  [see  Contraindications (4) ].   When prescribing codeine-containing drugs, healthcare professionals should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of morphine overdose.  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8),  Overdosage (10) ]            Concomitant use of opioids, including CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE, with benzodiazepines, or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death .  Because of these risks, avoid use of opioid cough medications in patients taking  Benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol [ see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. Because of similar pharmacologic properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with concomitant use of opioid cough medications and benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.  Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation if CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE is used with benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants. [ see    Patient Counseling Information (17)]             Codeine, one of the active ingredients in CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE, produces dose-related respiratory depression by directly acting on brain stem respiratory centers.   Overdose of codeine in adults has been associated with fatal respiratory depression, and the use of codeine in children has been associated with fatal respiratory depression.  Exercise caution when administering CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE because of the potential for respiratory depression. If respiratory depression occurs, discontinue CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE and use naloxone hydrochloride when indicated to antagonize the effect and other supportive measures as necessary.  [see  Overdosage (10) ].            Codeine can produce drug dependence of the morphine type and, therefore, has the potential for being abused. Psychological dependence, physical dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE. Prescribe and administer CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE with the same degree of caution appropriate to the use of other opioid drugs.  [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2 ,  9.3) ]             The respiratory depression effects of opioids and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions, or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce adverse reactions that may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.  The use of CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE should be avoided in these patients.           Codeine and chlorpheniramine, the active ingredients in CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE, may produce marked drowsiness and impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery.  Advise patients to avoid engaging in hazardous tasks requiring mental alertness and motor coordination after ingestion of CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE.  Concurrent use of CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur.           Chronic use of opioids, including codeine, may result in obstructive bowel disease especially in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders.  Codeine may cause or aggravate constipation.  Use with caution in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders.            CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE should be used with caution in patients with acute abdominal conditions since the administration of codeine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.  The concurrent use of other anticholinergics with codeine may produce paralytic ileus.  [see  Drug Interactions (7.3) ]            As with other opioids, CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE should be used with caution in elderly or debilitated patients and those with asthma, persistent or chronic cough, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture. The usual precautions should be observed and the possibility of respiratory depression should be kept in mind.</Section>
    <Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">Codeine : Codeine is a semisynthetic narcotic antitussive and analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine. The precise mechanism of action of codeine and other opiates is not known; however, codeine is believed to act centrally on the cough center. In excessive doses, codeine will depress respiration. Codeine can produce miosis, euphoria, and physical and physiological dependence.   Chlorpheniramine : Chlorpheniramine is a propylamine derivative antihistamine (H1-receptor antagonist) of the alkylamine class that also possesses anticholinergic and sedative activity. It prevents released histamine from dilating capillaries and causing edema of the respiratory mucosa.            Absorption   Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (Mean ± SD) for CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE in fasting, healthy volunteers are shown in the table below.           PK Parameter    Single-dose    Multiple-dose (BID for 6.5 days)       Codeine  Mean (± SD)    Chlorpheniramine Maleate  Mean (± SD)    Codeine  Mean (± SD)    Chlorpheniramine Maleate  Mean (± SD)      Tmax (h)    (Range)    3 (2-12)    6 (4-12)    3 (2-5)    5 (3-7)      Cmax (ng/mL)    46 (11)    9 (3)        AUCinf (ng.h/mL) for single-dose OR AUC12 (ng.h/mL) for multiple-dose    383 (99)    312 (137)        Half life (h)    4 (1)    21 (7)    Not determined    Not determined       Food Effect   The presence of a high-fat, high-calorie meal did not significantly impact the PK parameters of CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE.   Distribution   Codeine has been reported to have an apparent volume of distribution of approximately 3-6 L/kg, indicating extensive distribution of the drug into tissues. About 7-25% of codeine, reportedly, is bound to plasma proteins. Codeine passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier. Small amounts of codeine and its metabolite, morphine, are transferred to human breast milk.    Chlorpheniramine is widely distributed throughout the tissues of the body, including the central nervous system. It reportedly has an apparent steady-state volume of distribution of approximately 3.2 L/kg in adults and children and is about 70% bound to plasma proteins. Chlorpheniramine and its metabolites likely cross the placental barrier and are excreted into human breast milk.   Metabolism   About 70-80% of the administered dose of codeine is metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid to codeine-6‑ glucuronide (C6G) and via O-demethylation to morphine (about 5-10%) and N-demethylation to norcodeine (about 10%) respectively. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B4 are the major enzymes mediating glucurodination of codeine to C6G. Cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2D6 and CYP3A4 are the major enzymes mediating O-demethylation and N-demethylation of codeine respectively. Morphine and norcodeine are further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid. Morphine and its M6 glucuronide conjugate are pharmacologically active. Whether C6G has pharmacological activity is unknown. Norcodeine and M3 glucuronide conjugate of morphine are generally not considered to be pharmacologically active.   Chlorpheniramine is rapidly and extensively metabolized via demethylation in the liver, forming mono- and didesmethyl derivatives. Oxidative metabolism of chlorpheniramine is catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 2D6.   Elimination   Approximately 90% of the total dose of codeine is excreted through the kidneys, of which approximately 10% is unchanged codeine. Plasma half-life of codeine was observed to be about 4 hours with CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE.   Chlorpheniramine and its metabolites are primarily excreted through the kidneys, with large individual variation. Urinary excretion depends on urine pH and flow rate. Plasma half-life of chlorpheniramine was observed to be about 21 hours with CODEINE PHOSPHATE AND CHLORPHENIRAMINE MALEATE.</Section>
