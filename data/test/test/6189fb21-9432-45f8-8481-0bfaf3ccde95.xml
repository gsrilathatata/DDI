    <Section name="BOXED WARNING SECTION" id="34066-1">Serious harm or death could result if administered intravenously. SUBLOCADE forms a solid mass upon contact with body fluids and may cause occlusion, local tissue damage, and thrombo-embolic events, including life threatening pulmonary emboli, if administered intravenously. ( 5.1 )    Because of the risk of serious harm or death that could result from intravenous self-administration, SUBLOCADE is only available through a restricted program called the SUBLOCADE REMS Program. Healthcare settings and pharmacies that order and dispense SUBLOCADE must be certified in this program and comply with the REMS requirements. ( 5.2 )          WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS HARM OR DEATH WITH INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION; SUBLOCADE RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY    See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.     Serious harm or death could result if administered intravenously. ( 5.1 )    SUBLOCADE is only available through a restricted program called the SUBLOCADE REMS Program. Healthcare settings and pharmacies that order and dispense SUBLOCADE must be certified in this program and comply with the REMS requirements. ( 5.2 )</Section>
    <Section name="CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION" id="34070-3">SUBLOCADE should not be administered to patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to buprenorphine or any component of the ATRIGEL® delivery system  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] .
       Hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or any other ingredients in SUBLOCADE. ( 4 )</Section>
    <Section name="DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION SECTION" id="34068-7">Prescription use of this product is limited under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act. ( 2.1 )
  SUBLOCADE should only be prepared and administered by a healthcare provider. ( 2.2 )
  SUBLOCADE is administered monthly only by subcutaneous injection in the abdominal region. ( 2.2 )
  The recommended dose of SUBLOCADE is two monthly initial doses of 300 mg followed by 100 mg monthly maintenance doses. ( 2.3 )
  Increasing the maintenance dose to 300 mg monthly may be considered for patients in which the benefits outweigh the risks. ( 2.3 )
  Examine the injection site for signs of infection or evidence of tampering or attempts to remove the depot. ( 2.5 )
  See Full Prescribing Information for administration instructions. ( 2.6 )
           Under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) codified at 21 U.S.C. 823(g), prescription use of this product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to healthcare providers who meet certain qualifying requirements, and who have notified the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent to prescribe this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique identification number that must be included on every prescription.            FOR ABDOMINAL SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTION ONLY.  DO NOT ADMINISTER SUBLOCADE INTRAVENOUSLY OR INTRAMUSCULARLY  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] .
   Only healthcare providers should prepare and administer SUBLOCADE.
  Administer SUBLOCADE monthly with a minimum of 26 days between doses.
  Initiating treatment with SUBLOCADE as the first buprenorphine product has not been studied.   Initiate SUBLOCADE treatment only following induction and dose-adjustment with a transmucosal buprenorphine-containing product  [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] .
  Administer each injection only using the syringe and safety needle included with the product  [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] .
            The recommended dose of SUBLOCADE following induction and dose adjustment with transmucosal buprenorphine is 300 mg monthly for the first two months followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg monthly.  
  The maintenance dose may be increased to 300 mg monthly for patients who tolerate the 100 mg dose, but do not demonstrate a satisfactory clinical response, as evidenced by self-reported illicit opioid use or urine drug screens positive for illicit opioid use.
  A patient who misses a dose should receive the next dose as soon as possible, with the following dose given no less than 26 days later.  Occasional delays in dosing up to 2 weeks are not expected to have a clinically significant impact on treatment effect.
           Patients appropriate for SUBLOCADE are adults who have initiated treatment on a transmucosal buprenorphine-containing product delivering the equivalent of 8 to 24 mg of buprenorphine daily. The patient may only be transitioned to SUBLOCADE after a minimum of 7 days.
  Initiation of treatment with transmucosal buprenorphine-containing products should be based on instructions in their appropriate product label. One SUBOXONE® (buprenorphine and naloxone) 8 mg/2 mg sublingual tablet provides equivalent buprenorphine exposure to one SUBUTEX® (buprenorphine HCl) 8 mg sublingual tablet or one Bunavail® (buprenorphine and naloxone) 4.2mg/0.7 mg buccal film or one Zubsolv® (buprenorphine and naloxone) 5.7 mg/1.4 mg sublingual tablet.
           Periodic assessment is necessary to determine effectiveness of the treatment plan and overall patient progress. When evaluating the patient, examine the injection site for signs of infection or evidence of tampering or attempts to remove the depot.
  Due to the chronic nature of opioid use disorder, the need for continuing medication-assisted treatment should be re-evaluated periodically. There is no maximum recommended duration of maintenance treatment. For some patients, treatment may continue indefinitely. If considering stopping treatment, the clinical status of the patient should be considered.
  If SUBLOCADE is discontinued, its extended-release characteristics should be considered and the patient should be monitored for several months for signs and symptoms of withdrawal and treated appropriately. After steady-state has been achieved (4-6 months), patients discontinuing SUBLOCADE may have detectable plasma levels of buprenorphine for twelve months or longer. The correlation between plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and those detectable in urine is not known.
           IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
   For abdominal subcutaneous injection only  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .
  To be prepared and administered by a healthcare provider only.
  Please read the instructions carefully before handling the product.
  As a universal precaution, always wear gloves.
  Remove SUBLOCADE from the refrigerator prior to administration. The product requires at least 15 minutes to reach room temperature. Do not open the foil pouch until the patient has arrived for his or her injection.
  Discard SUBLOCADE if left at room temperature for longer than 7 days.
  Do not attach the needle until time of administration.
   STEP 1: GETTING READY
  Remove the foil pouch and safety needle from the carton. Open the pouch and remove the syringe.
  Discard the oxygen absorber pack. It is not needed.
   Figure 1      STEP 2: CHECK THE LIQUID CLARITY
  Check that the medication does not contain contaminants or particles. SUBLOCADE ranges from colorless to yellow to amber. Variations of color within this range do not affect the potency of the product.
  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
   Figure 2      STEP 3: ATTACH THE SAFETY NEEDLE
  Remove the cap from the syringe and the safety needle supplied in the carton from its sterile package.
  Gently twist the needle clockwise until it is tight and firmly attached.
  Do not remove the plastic cover from the needle.
   Figure 3      STEP 4: PREPARE THE ABDOMINAL INJECTION SITE
  Choose an injection site on the abdomen between the transpyloric and transtubercular planes with adequate subcutaneous tissue that is free of skin conditions (e.g., nodules, lesions, excessive pigment). It is recommended that the patient is in the supine position.
  Do not inject into an area where the skin is irritated, reddened, bruised, infected or scarred in any way.
  Clean the injection site well with an alcohol swab.
  To avoid irritation, rotate injection sites following a pattern similar to the illustration in  Figure 4 . Record the location of the injection to ensure that a different site is used at the time of the next injection.
   Figure 4      STEP 5: REMOVE EXCESS AIR FROM SYRINGE
  Hold the syringe upright for several seconds to allow air bubbles to rise. Due to the viscous nature of the medication, bubbles will not rise as quickly as those in an aqueous solution.
  Remove needle cover and slowly depress the plunger to push out the excess air from the syringe.
   Small bubbles may remain in the medication. Large air gaps, however, can be minimized by pulling back on the plunger rod to pop air bubbles prior to expelling the air very slowly. Air should be expelled very carefully to avoid loss of medication.
   If medication is seen at the needle tip, pull back slightly on the plunger to prevent medication spillage.
   Figure 5      STEP 6: PINCH THE INJECTION SITE
  Pinch the skin around the injection area. Be sure to pinch enough skin to accommodate the size of the needle. Lift the adipose tissue from the underlying muscle to prevent accidental intramuscular injection.
   Figure 6      STEP 7: INJECT THE MEDICATION
  SUBLOCADE is for subcutaneous injection only. Do not inject intravenously or intramuscularly  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .
  Insert needle fully into the abdominal subcutaneous tissue. Actual angle of injection will depend on the amount of subcutaneous tissue.
  Use a slow, steady push to inject the medication. Continue pushing until all of the medication is given.
   Figure 7      STEP 8: WITHDRAW THE NEEDLE
  Withdraw the needle at the same angle used for insertion and release the pinched skin.
  Do not rub the injection area after the injection. If there is bleeding, apply a gauze pad or bandage but use minimal pressure.
   Figure 8      STEP 9: LOCK THE NEEDLE GUARD AND DISCARD THE SYRINGE
  Lock the needle guard into place by pushing it against a hard surface such as a table ( Figure 9 ).
  Dispose of all syringe components in a secure sharps disposal container.
   Figure 9      STEP 10: INSTRUCT THE PATIENT
  Advise the patient that they may have a lump for several weeks that will decrease in size over time.  Instruct the patient not to rub or massage the injection site and to be aware of the placement of any belts or clothing waistbands.

              SUBLOCADE is subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program that includes, among other elements, a restricted distribution system.  The purpose of the restricted distribution system is to ensure that SUBLOCADE is only administered by a health care provider  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] .
           In the event the depot must be removed, it can be surgically excised under local anesthesia within 14 days of injection.  Only the most recently-injected depot can be removed.
  The removed depot should be handled with adequate security, accountability, and proper disposal, per facility procedure for a Schedule III drug product and pharmaceutical biohazardous waste, and per applicable federal, state, and local regulations.
  The residual plasma concentrations from previous injections will decrease gradually over subsequent months  [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .
  Patients who have the depot removed should be monitored for signs and symptoms of withdrawal and treated appropriately  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] .</Section>
    <Section name="DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION" id="34073-7">Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with SUBLOCADE.
   Table 4.  Clinically Significant Drug Interactions
       Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants      Clinical Impact:   Due to additive pharmacologic effects, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.
     Intervention:   Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use.  In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.   Similarly, cessation of other CNS depressants is preferred when possible. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines for anxiety or insomnia, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ,  5.5 )] .
     Examples:   Alcohol, non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids.
     Inhibitors of CYP3A4      Clinical Impact:   The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inhibitors on buprenorphine exposure in subjects treated with SUBLOCADE have not been studied and the effects may be dependent on the route of administration; however, such interactions have been established in studies using transmucosal buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine primarily by CYP3A4; therefore, potential interactions may occur when SUBLOCADE is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of sublingual buprenorphine and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) can increase the plasma concentration of buprenorphine, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects.
     Intervention:   Patients who transfer to SUBLOCADE treatment from a regimen of transmucosal buprenorphine used concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors [e.g., azole antifungals such as ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir)] should be monitored to ensure that the plasma buprenorphine level provided by SUBLOCADE is adequate.  If patients already on SUBLOCADE require newly-initiated treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of over-medication.  Within 2 weeks of SUBLOCADE administration, if signs and symptoms of buprenorphine toxicity or overdose occur but the concomitant medication cannot be reduced or discontinued, it may be necessary to remove the depot and treat the patient with a formulation of buprenorphine that permits dose adjustments.  Conversely, if a patient has been stabilized on SUBLOCADE in the setting of concomitant medication that is a CYP3A4 inhibitor, and the concomitant medication is discontinued, the patient should be monitored for withdrawal. If the dose of SUBLOCADE is not adequate in the absence of the concomitant medication, that patient should be transitioned back to a formulation of buprenorphine that permits dose adjustments.
     Examples:   Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir)
     CYP3A4 Inducers      Clinical Impact:   The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inducers on buprenorphine exposure in subjects treated with SUBLOCADE have not been studied. Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine primarily by CYP3A4; therefore, potential interactions may occur when SUBLOCADE is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. CYP3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of buprenorphine and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in buprenorphine plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome.
     Intervention:   Patients who transfer to SUBLOCADE treatment from a regimen of transmucosal buprenorphine used concomitantly with CYP3A4 inducers should be monitored to ensure that the plasma buprenorphine level provided by SUBLOCADE is adequate. If patients already on SUBLOCADE require newly-initiated treatment with CYP3A4 inducers, the patients should be monitored for withdrawal. If the dose of SUBLOCADE is not adequate in the absence of the concomitant medication, and the concomitant medication cannot be reduced or discontinued, that patient should be transitioned back to a formulation of buprenorphine that permits dose adjustments. Conversely, if a patient has been stabilized on SUBLOCADE in the setting of concomitant medication that is a CYP3A4 inducer, and the concomitant medication is discontinued, the patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of over-medication. Within 2 weeks of SUBLOCADE administration, if the dose provided by SUBLOCADE is excessive in the absence of the concomitant inducer, it may be necessary to remove the SUBLOCADE and treat the patient with a formulation of buprenorphine that permits dose adjustments  [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .
     Examples:   Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital
     Antiretrovirals: Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)      Clinical Impact:   Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are metabolized principally by CYP3A4. Efavirenz, nevirapine, and etravirine are known CYP3A inducers, whereas delavirdine is a CYP3A inhibitor. Significant pharmacokinetic interactions between NNRTIs (e.g., efavirenz and delavirdine) and sublingual buprenorphine have been shown in clinical studies, but these pharmacokinetic interactions did not result in any significant pharmacodynamic effects.
     Intervention:   Patients who are on chronic treatment with SUBLOCADE should be monitored for increase or decrease in therapeutic effects if NNRTIs are added to their treatment regimen.
     Examples:   Efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, delavirdine
     Antiretrovirals: Protease inhibitors (PIs)      Clinical Impact:   Studies have shown some antiretroviral protease inhibitors (PIs) with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (nelfinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir) have little effect on sublingual buprenorphine pharmacokinetic and no significant pharmacodynamic effects. Other PIs with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir) resulted in elevated levels of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine after sublingual administration, and patients in one study reported increased sedation. Symptoms of opioid excess have been found in postmarketing reports of patients receiving sublingual buprenorphine and atazanavir with and without ritonavir concomitantly.
     Intervention:   If treatment with atazanavir with and without ritonavir must be initiated in a patient already treated with SUBLOCADE, the patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of over-medication. It may be necessary to remove the depot and treat the patient with a sublingual buprenorphine product that permits rapid dose adjustments.
     Examples:   Atazanavir, ritonavir
     Antiretrovirals: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)      Clinical Impact:   Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) do not appear to induce or inhibit the P450 enzyme pathway, thus no interactions with buprenorphine are expected.
     Intervention:   None
     Serotonergic Drugs      Clinical Impact:   The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.
     Intervention:   If concomitant use is warranted, carefully monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation, and during dose adjustment of the serotonergic drug.
     Examples:   Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).
     Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)      Clinical Impact:   MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma).
     Intervention:   The use of SUBLOCADE is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.
     Examples:   Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid
     Muscle Relaxants      Clinical Impact:   Buprenorphine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.
     Intervention:   Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and SUBLOCADE for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of the muscle relaxant as necessary.
     Diuretics      Clinical Impact:   Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.
     Intervention:   Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.
     Anticholinergic Drugs      Clinical Impact:   The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase the risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.
     Intervention:   Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when SUBLOCADE is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.
           CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers : Monitor patients starting or ending CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers for potential over- or under-dosing. ( 7 )
   Serotonergic Drugs : If concomitant use is warranted, monitor for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation, and during dose adjustment of the serotonergic drug. ( 7 )</Section>
    <Section name="WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION" id="43685-7">Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse : Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. Monitor patients for conditions indicative of diversion or progression of opioid dependence and addictive behaviors. ( 5.3 )
   Respiratory Depression : Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with SUBLOCADE. ( 5.4 ,  5.5 )
   Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome : Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy. ( 5.6 )
   Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.7 )
   Risk of Opioid Withdrawal With Abrupt Discontinuation : If treatment with SUBLOCADE is discontinued, monitor patients for several months for withdrawal and treat appropriately. ( 5.8 )
   Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events : Monitor liver function tests prior to and during treatment. ( 5.9 )
   Risk of Withdrawal in Patients Dependent on Full Agonist Opioids :
  Verify that patient is clinically stable on transmucosal buprenorphine before injecting SUBLOCADE. ( 5.11 )
   Treatment of Emergent Acute Pain : Treat pain with a non-opioid analgesic whenever possible. If opioid therapy is required, monitor patients closely because higher doses may be required for analgesic effect. ( 5.12 )
          Intravenous injection presents significant risk of serious harm or death as SUBLOCADE forms a solid mass upon contact with body fluids. Occlusion, local tissue damage, and thrombo-embolic events, including life threatening pulmonary emboli, could result if administered intravenously  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.2 )] . Do not administer intravenously or intramuscularly.
           SUBLOCADE is available only through a restricted program called the SUBLOCADE REMS Program because of the risk of serious harm or death that could result from intravenous self-administration. The goal of the REMS is to mitigate serious harm or death that could result from intravenous self-administration by ensuring that healthcare settings and pharmacies are certified and only dispense SUBLOCADE directly to a healthcare provider for administration by a health care provider.
  Notable requirements of the SUBLOCADE REMS Program include the following:
   Healthcare Settings and Pharmacies that order and dispense SUBLOCADE must be certified in the SUBLOCADE REMS Program.
  Certified Healthcare Settings and Pharmacies must establish processes and procedures to verify SUBLOCADE is provided directly to a healthcare provider for administration by a healthcare provider, and the drug is not dispensed to the patient.
  Certified Healthcare Settings and Pharmacies must not distribute, transfer, loan, or sell SUBLOCADE.
   Further information is available at www.SublocadeREMS.com or call 1-866-258-3905.
           SUBLOCADE contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance that can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. Buprenorphine is sought by people with opioid use disorder and is subject to criminal diversion. Monitor all patients for progression of opioid use disorder and addictive behaviors  [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.2 )] .
           Buprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, postmarketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol.  Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with SUBLOCADE  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )].   Use SUBLOCADE with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression).
  Due to its extended-release characteristics, if SUBLOCADE is discontinued as a result of compromised respiratory function, monitor patients for ongoing buprenorphine effects for several months.
           Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose, respiratory depression, and death.  Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs.  Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.
  As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol.
  Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate.
  Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use with buprenorphine.  In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.
  For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia.  Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia.  Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient's buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use.
  In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs.  Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines  [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] .
           Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly  [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] .
  Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with SUBLOCADE of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available  [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . This risk should be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy.
           Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.
           Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation. The withdrawal syndrome is milder than that seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset  [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )] .
  Withdrawal signs and symptoms were not observed in the month following discontinuation of SUBLOCADE. Considering the long half-life, any withdrawal signs and symptoms that may occur would be expected to be delayed  [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Model simulations indicate that steady-state buprenorphine plasma concentrations decreased slowly over time following the last injection and remained at therapeutic levels for 2 to 5 months on average, depending on the dosage administered (100 or 300 mg, respectively). 
  Patients who elect to discontinue treatment with SUBLOCADE should be monitored for withdrawal signs and symptoms. Consider transmucosal buprenorphine if needed to treat withdrawal after discontinuing SUBLOCADE.
           Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through postmarketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases, however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. In one subject in the SUBLOCADE clinical program, surgical removal was followed by improvement in liver enzymes.
  Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment, are recommended to establish a baseline. Monthly monitoring of liver function during treatment, particularly with 300 mg maintenance dose, is also recommended. An etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic adverse event is suspected.
           Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine-containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the postmarketing experience.  Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus.  A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine is a contraindication to the use of SUBLOCADE  [see Contraindications ( 4 )] .
           Because of the partial opioid agonist properties of buprenorphine, buprenorphine may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in persons who are currently physically dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone before the effects of the full opioid agonist have subsided. Verify that patients have tolerated and are dose adjusted on transmucosal buprenorphine before subcutaneously injecting SUBLOCADE.
           While on SUBLOCADE, situations may arise where patients need acute pain management, or may require anesthesia. Treat patients receiving SUBLOCADE with a non-opioid analgesic whenever possible. Patients requiring opioid therapy for analgesia may be treated with a high-affinity full opioid analgesic under the supervision of a physician, with particular attention to respiratory function. Higher doses may be required for analgesic effect. Therefore, a higher potential for toxicity exists with opioid administration. If opioid therapy is required as part of anesthesia, patients should be continuously monitored in an anesthesia care setting by persons not involved in the conduct of the surgical or diagnostic procedure. The opioid therapy should be provided by individuals specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids, specifically the establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation.
  Advise patients of the importance of instructing their family members, in the event of emergency, to inform the treating healthcare provider or emergency room staff that the patient is physically dependent on an opioid and that the patient is being treated with SUBLOCADE  [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] .
  The above guidance should also be considered for any patient who has been treated with SUBLOCADE within the last 6 months.
           There have been reported deaths of opioid naïve individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet. SUBLOCADE is not appropriate for use in opioid naïve patients.
           In a pharmacokinetic study with transmucosal buprenorphine, buprenorphine plasma levels were found to be higher and the half-life was found to be longer in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, but not in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of SUBLOCADE has not been studied.
  Because of the long-acting nature of the product, adjustments to dosages of SUBLOCADE are not rapidly reflected in plasma buprenorphine levels. Because buprenorphine levels cannot be rapidly decreased, patients with pre-existing moderate to severe hepatic impairment are not candidates for treatment with SUBLOCADE.
  Patients who develop moderate to severe hepatic impairment while being treated with SUBLOCADE should be monitored for several months for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine  [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .
           Buprenorphine has been observed to prolong the QTc interval in some patients participating in clinical trials. Consider these observations in clinical decisions when prescribing buprenorphine to patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or clinically unstable cardiac disease, including unstable atrial fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, or active myocardial ischemia. Periodic electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is recommended in these patients. Avoid the use of buprenorphine in patients with a history of Long QT Syndrome or an immediate family member with this condition or those taking Class IA antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) or Class III antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide), or other medications that prolong the QT interval  [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )].            SUBLOCADE may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery especially during the first few days following treatment and dose adjustment.  Buprenorphine plasma levels accumulate during the first two months and are maintained with the 100 mg maintenance dose; further accumulation occurs with the 300 mg maintenance dose, which achieves steady-state after the fourth monthly injection. Caution patients about driving or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that SUBLOCADE does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.
           Buprenorphine may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.
           Buprenorphine may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased.  Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation.
           Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.
           Buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.
           Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it.</Section>
    <Section name="CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION" id="34090-1">SUBLOCADE Injection contains buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu- opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor.
                 Mu-Opioid Receptor Occupancy and Association With Opioid Blockade   In a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study with SUBLOCADE in 2 subjects (one subject receiving 200 mg SC injections and one subject receiving 300 mg SC injections) with opioid use disorder, 75 to 92% occupancy of the mu-opioid receptors in the brain was maintained for 28 days following the last dose under steady-state conditions.
  The opioid blockade study evaluated the blockade of subjective opioid effects, pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of SC injections of SUBLOCADE.  Stabilization doses of SL buprenorphine prior to injection of SUBLOCADE failed to provide full blockade of subjective effects of hydromorphone 18 mg IM.  After SUBLOCADE injections at Weeks 0 and 4, on average, subjective effects of both 6 mg and 18 mg doses of hydromorphone were blocked; however, wide variability was seen across subjects.  Complete blockade continued throughout the 8 weeks of observation that followed the 2 nd SUBLOCADE injection  [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] .
   Figure 10 illustrates the relationship between buprenorphine plasma level and drug liking after 18 mg hydromorphone IM.
   Figure 10. Drug Liking VAS vs. Plasma Buprenorphine Concentration Following 18 mg Hydromorphone Challenges      Exposure-response relationships were assessed for illicit opioid use, based on urine samples negative for illicit opioids combined with self-reports negative for illicit opioid use, and withdrawal symptoms using data obtained from 489 opioid dependent patients in the double-blind Phase 3 Study (13-0001).
  The observed plateau for maximal response was reached at buprenorphine plasma concentrations of approximately 2-3 ng/mL for illicit opioid use and 4 ng/mL for opioid withdrawal symptoms.
  Population PK/PD modeling indicated that patients using opioids by the injectable route at baseline may require higher buprenorphine exposure compared to patients not using opioids by the injectable route at baseline.
        Figure 10
             Cardiac Electrophysiology   Serial ECGs were collected following a single dose and at steady-state to evaluate the effect of SUBLOCADE on the QT interval in five clinical studies including the Phase 3 study. In a Phase 3 study, seven patients had an increase from baseline QTc greater than 60 msec at any time [2/203 patients (1.0%) in the 300 mg/100 mg group and 5/201 patients (2.0%) in the 300 mg/300 mg group] and one patient in the 300 mg/300 mg group was found to have a QTc greater than 500 msec. These QTc findings were all sporadic and transient and none led to aberrant ventricular rhythm. Review of ECG and adverse event data provided no evidence for syncope, seizure, or ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
            Physiological Effects   Buprenorphine in IV (2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 mg) and sublingual (12 mg) doses have been administered to opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent to examine cardiovascular, respiratory, and subjective effects at doses comparable to those used for treatment of opioid dependence. Compared to placebo, there were no statistically significant differences among any of the treatment conditions for blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, O 2 saturation, or skin temperature across time.  Systolic BP was higher in the 8 mg group than placebo (3 hour AUC values). Minimum and maximum effects were similar across all treatments.  Subjects remained responsive to low voice and responded to computer prompts. Some subjects showed irritability, but no other changes were observed.  The respiratory effects of sublingual buprenorphine were compared with the effects of methadone in a double-blind, parallel group, dose ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg) and oral methadone (15, 30, 45, or 60 mg) in non-dependent, opioid-experienced volunteers. In this study, hypoventilation not requiring medical intervention was reported more frequently after buprenorphine doses of 4 mg and higher than after methadone. Both drugs decreased O 2 saturation to the same degree.
  In clinical studies conducted with SUBLOCADE at doses ranging from 50 to 300 mg, no incidences of temperature elevations, or clinically significant lowering of oxygen saturation were observed.
            Androgen Deficiency     Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation.
                   Absorption   The pharmacokinetics (PK) of buprenorphine following subcutaneous injection of SUBLOCADE was evaluated in subjects with opioid use disorder after single doses (50 mg to 200 mg) and repeated doses (50 to 300 mg) separated by 28 days for up to 12 injections.
  After SUBLOCADE injection, an initial buprenorphine peak was observed and the median T max occurred at 24 hours after injection.  After the initial buprenorphine peak, the plasma buprenorphine concentrations decreased slowly to a plateau.  Steady-state was achieved at 4-6 months. Observed mean buprenorphine concentrations levels for C avg , C max and C min are presented in  Table 6 .

               Distribution   Buprenorphine is approximately 96% protein bound, primarily to alpha and beta globulin.
            Elimination   Buprenorphine is metabolized and eliminated in urine and feces. The apparent terminal plasma half-life of buprenorphine following subcutaneous injection of SUBLOCADE ranged between 43 to 60 days as a result of the slow release of buprenorphine from the subcutaneous depot.
            Metabolism   Buprenorphine is metabolized to its major metabolite, norbuprenorphine, primarily by CYP3A4. Norbuprenorphine can further undergo glucuronidation. Norbuprenorphine has been found to bind opioid receptors  in vitro ; however, it has not been studied clinically for opioid-like activity. Norbuprenorphine steady-state plasma concentrations in humans after subcutaneous injection of SUBLOCADE are low compared to buprenorphine (AUC norbuprenorphine/buprenorphine ratio of 0.20 to 0.40).
            Excretion   A mass balance study of buprenorphine administered by IV infusion in humans showed complete recovery of radiolabel in urine (30%) and feces (69%) collected up to 11 days after dosing.  Almost all of the dose was accounted for in terms of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, and two unidentified buprenorphine metabolites. In urine, most of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were conjugated (buprenorphine: 1% free and 9.4% conjugated; norbuprenorphine: 2.7% free and 11% conjugated). In feces, almost all of the buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were free (buprenorphine: 33% free and 5% conjugated; norbuprenorphine: 21% free and 2% conjugated).
            Drug Interaction Studies             CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers   The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers on buprenorphine exposure in subjects treated with SUBLOCADE have not been studied; however, such interactions have been established in studies using transmucosal buprenorphine.  The effects of buprenorphine may be dependent on the route of administration.
  Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine primarily by cytochrome CYP3A4; therefore, potential interactions may occur when SUBLOCADE is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors have been established in studies using transmucosal buprenorphine.  Patients who transfer to SUBLOCADE treatment from a regimen of transmucosal buprenorphine used concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), or HIV protease inhibitors, or CYP3A4 inducer (e.g., phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) should be monitored to ensure that the plasma buprenorphine level provided by SUBLOCADE is adequate and not excessive  [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )].   Buprenorphine has been found to be a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor and its major metabolite, norbuprenorphine, has been found to be a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor in in vitro studies employing human liver microsomes.  However, the plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine resulting from therapeutic SUBLOCADE doses are not expected to significantly affect metabolism of other co-medications.
            Specific Populations   Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, age, sex and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on PK of SUBLOCADE.
            Hepatic Impairment   The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of SUBLOCADE has not been studied. However, the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of buprenorphine has been evaluated in a study using 2 mg/0.5 mg buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet in subjects with various degrees of hepatic impairment as indicated by Child-Pugh criteria. While no clinically relevant changes were observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, buprenorphine plasma exposure was increased by 64% and 181% in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects  [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] .
            Renal Impairment   The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of SUBLOCADE has not been studied.  Clinical studies of SUBLOCADE did not include subjects with severe renal impairment.
  Less than 1% is excreted as unchanged buprenorphine in urine following IV buprenorphine administration.  No differences in buprenorphine pharmacokinetics were observed between 9 dialysis-dependent and 6 normal patients following IV administration of 0.3 mg buprenorphine  [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] .
  Population PK analyses indicated no notable relationship between creatinine clearance and steady-state buprenorphine plasma concentrations.
   HCV infection   In subjects with HCV infection but no sign of hepatic impairment, the changes in the mean C max , AUC 0-last , and half-life values of buprenorphine were not clinically significant in comparison to healthy subjects without HCV infection. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with HCV infection.</Section>
